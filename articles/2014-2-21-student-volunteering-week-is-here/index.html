    <p>Next week is Student Volunteering Week (SVW), a nationwide celebration of the power of student volunteering. Imperial College London is one of many universities celebrating SVW, with activities coordinated by students from Imperial Hub’s Local Action Committee in collaboration with the Union. We’re aiming to showcase the diverse positive impact that we can make in our local communities, inspire new or further engagement with social issues, and highlight how easy it is to get involved as a student. The week is organised by students for students, and whether you volunteer weekly, in the holidays, or not at all, there’s something for everyone.</p>

<p>For students on Imperial Hub’s Local Action Committee, it’s exciting that the week has finally arrived. Planning for SVW began back in November with weekly meetings to decide the aims and put together a programme of events to engage a wide range of their fellow students. They were also committed to showcasing the efforts of current student volunteers and have partnered with a number of student groups to raise awareness of their opportunities throughout the week. You might not realise that there are nearly 3,500 Imperial students who volunteer through the Union or Imperial Hub. From delivering the Union’s services and activities to tackling social and environmental issues, these students demonstrate a commitment to going above and beyond for others.</p>

<p>In preparation for the week, the SVW team interviewed Imperial students who volunteer in a range of different projects. Sijia Yu, a first year biologist, is involved in Imperial Hub’s Schools Plus programme. She is one of 150 Imperial students who provide 800+ hours of free tuition each term to disadvantaged pupils in local schools and community organisations. She described her experience: “I volunteer in the First Georgian supplementary school as a Science and Maths tutor. Nearly all the students have Georgian bloodline, most of them cannot speak English very well and can’t understand some scientific terms due to the language barrier. I try to use simple words or synonyms to explain a concept when they feel confused, and I have found graphs and videos to be very useful. Two months ago, the school set up wifi, so we are now able to show students the relevant images when they have no idea what a word means. In addition, sometimes I use Russian to assist tuition because most students there speak Russian; it is unusual, but it does work! Nevertheless, all of the volunteers are always trying their very best to help these students.”</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the volunteers make a positive impact on the pupils they tutor. A teacher in North Kensington told us, “Our pupils enjoy working with Imperial students because they are passionate about their subjects. Having young tutors means that pupils can relate to them and we really appreciate their time and efforts.”</p>

<p>Another student that was interviewed, William Brown, a Chemical Engineering undergrad and chair of tutoring project TEAM Students emphasised the skills you can gain from volunteering. “Volunteers learn at least as much as their pupils. Our volunteers come from many different backgrounds and all have different reasons for joining, but a common theme is the strong desire to help those less fortunate and our project as a whole is a very powerful manifestation of this desire. Tuition teaches patience, professionalism, flexibility and time management skills – all very important for a student’s personal development.”</p>

<p>Matthew Proctor, a second year physicist who volunteers at the Imperial College Cooperative stall on Thursdays in Sherfield, shared similar views. “I think student volunteering is an excellent opportunity to meet new friends and develop your skills. It gives me the chance to work with a brilliant group of intelligent, interesting, and funny students who are very passionate about their work. It’s also fun. With such a tough degree that sometimes gets overwhelming, working on the stall is something I look forward to every week and it’s just such an enriching experience that I’d highly recommend to anyone thinking about volunteering.”</p>

<p>Off campus, the student group Soup Run provides food, drink and company to local homeless and vulnerable people. Heather Jeffery, Soup Run Coordinator, explained, “The Soup Run gives Imperial students the opportunity to do something completely different to their studies. Volunteering in the community is personally rewarding and it makes a difference to the lives of those in need.”</p>

<p>Maddy Maxwell, a second year Medic who is coordinating SVW through Imperial Hub, said: “We believe that the number of Imperial student volunteers and the impact that they make is underestimated, so we’re looking forward to using SVW to showcase the diverse positive impact that we can make in our local communities, inspire new or further engagement with social issues, and highlight how easy it is to get involved as a student both during the week and beyond.”</p>

<p>Interacting with your local community outside of the lecture theatre, laboratory or library can be hugely valuable and SVW is all about giving every Imperial student a chance to try something new. As well as on-campus events, you can get involved in our local boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea and Hammersmith and Fulham, as well as in Westminster, Camden, Hillingdon, Islington, Tower Hamlets, Southwark and Lambeth.</p>
