  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Can you tell us a bit about your current business in the sustainability sector?</p>

<p>Yes I can! Our name is Whotter; our team consists of myself, Carlo, a PHD from Physics and Arthur a Masters student from Paris. We are trying to harness green energy from waste as never done before. It’s an innovative idea, we have some funding in the bag and a coach, Nicola (a successful entrepreneur) to help us with it. Our aim is to provide a more environmentally friendly technology in comparison to incineration, Anaerobic digestion etc, to harness energy while sustainably treating waste on a large scale. We have been working on the idea for about three months now and have faced a number of hurdles. In fact the initial idea actually failed when we put it to test hypothetically in the market, but we did learn a lot from the failure and now have kind of refined it! Fingers crossed, if all goes well we might have a start-up very soon inshallah [God willing]!</p>

<p>I understand that you were selected for the scheme as part of a competition that you entered. Other than backing the business idea, what else does the prize include?</p>

<p>Yes, our idea was selected in a scheme called Green House run by Climate-KIC, we got our funding and coach as part of this scheme. It all started last summer, all three of us were selected by Climate-KIC. We were taken on a fully sponsored five week trip around Europe, we were taught and coached by top CEO’s and business gurus from Europe about climate related entrepreneurship, which basically involved creating innovative businesses that not only make profit, but are also environmentally friendly. Being a Climate-KIC student allows us to apply to go to certain green tech conferences around the world, as well as learn and network with the crème de la crème in the sustainability/environment innovation field.</p>

<p>Ok that is really cool that you have been given business lectures and travelled around Europe. What has been your favourite part so far?</p>

<p>Nothing beats the journey or, in other words, the exotic holiday, haha! It consisted of 40 people with a similar interest (working against climate change); it lasted five weeks and three exotic countries were visited (Hungary, Netherlands and Spain). We got treated like VIPs, made some amazing friends, had one hell of a time and learnt all there is to know about green innovation and entrepreneurship. I don’t think any summer school can beat that! It was a life changing experience, I would really recommend it! Check it out on the climate-KIC website. climate-kic.org/for-students/summer-school/</p>

<p>What was the motivation for entering this programme?</p>

<p>My motivation to enter this programme was the summer journey. I have always been interested in entrepreneurship, innovation and sustainability; the moment I saw the opportunity, I knew it was THE perfectly crafted summer tailored to my interests!</p>

<p>What inspired you to start a business?</p>

<p>I prefer working for myself than for somebody else! Business requires hard work and responsibility, but you also have the opportunity to learn loads. For example with an engineering job, I would probably only learn the technical stuff. But with my business, I do the technical side as well as handle all of the business elements. More importantly, I think it is much easier to contribute to society with a start-up, as you are in the thick of innovating something that solves a community issue and makes things better for others. Imperial has great talent, I would highly recommend people here to consider creating a start-up. You have to give a lot into it but you definitely get loads out of it!</p>

<p>I understand you are also organising TedX at Imperial. Tell me more about it.</p>

<p>Yes, we have a committee of about ten people. We have been working for about three months now to make TEDxIC awesome! I have personally been involved more on the speaker and sponsorship side. We have handpicked some amazing speakers, ranging from inspiring youth leaders to big time entrepreneurs. Our theme is “one step ahead” so most of them will be talking about amazing stuff they have been pioneering. The event is on the 29th of March, tickets are limited and the event is gonna be brilliant. Be there or be square! <a href="http://www.tedximperialcollege.co.uk/">http://www.tedximperialcollege.co.uk/</a></p>

<p>What other major projects have you been involved with in the past?</p>

<p>Well I was the ex-International Student’s Officer at Cardiff uni. I have also worked extensively with Islamic societies; they do some amazing work, you have probably heard about Charity Week. [Imperial ISoc raised almost £70,000 last year!] Like WHAAA, I know! I have been doing lots of debating and recently participated in LIMUN (London International Model United Nations). I have recently started blogging and done my first blog and a series of mini blogs on Love.</p>

<p>How did you find being the Interational Students Officer (ISO)?</p>

<p>I had two massive achievements! I lobbied the university to have a fixed fee policy for international students, so fees don’t unfairly increase year on year. Cardiff was the first university in England and Wales to accept this policy, so yeah it was quite big! It will be implemented this year onwards and will save international students about a million pounds over the next five years! The second was campaigning to provide quiet rooms in every new building that is built, so students can practise their faith without being worried about walking a kilometre or missing lectures.</p>

<p>With MUN will you be taking part in any conferences or events?</p>

<p>Yes, I have managed to acquire some funding to participate and represent Imperial in the National Model United Nations (NMUN) conference in New York this month. I’m really excited about that! Don’t worry, I’ll die before letting Imperial down!</p>

<p>And what is the ‘Love is in the air’ campaign about?</p>

<p>Love is the only infinite element on earth and it’s just sad to see how little of it we use. So I wrote a blog talking about how love is not only for Valentine’s day or Mother’s day, but for every day. As Prophet Muhammad (Pbuh) said “love for your brother what you love for yourself”, we have to eliminate envy, hate, jealousy from our lives. One way to do this is by incorporating small actions of love towards our neighbours, animals, plants, strangers, parents and so on! To demonstrate this I did a mini campaign for ten days of random acts of kindness. One example was where I accompanied Emma, an 85 year old who was walking alone to her home; on the way she shared some amusing stories from her past. More importantly, talking to someone made her really happy! Such people deserve much better! I hope others actually get inspired enough from these acts and spread some love. Actually, you should check it out, you might like it: <a href="http://sheikhabdullarashid.wordpress.com/">http://sheikhabdullarashid.wordpress.com/</a></p>

<p>That was a very impressive list of accomplishments, what do you hope to do in the future?</p>

<p>My aim in life is to do something that benefits the community, particularly the needy. As I mentioned earlier, this can be done via innovation and entrepreneurship and that is my immediate plan. However, I think the amount of work that can be done by being a politician is significant, for example what I achieved as International Officer couldn’t have been possible by being just a student. So I do envision getting into Indian politics and working very hard to help the people! Wish me luck.</p>

<p>Any last comments or recommendations for Imperial students?</p>

<p>Be ambitious, aim and work very hard for the wider good, spread love all around and don’t worry too much about happiness. Let Newton’s third law work itself up: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction!</p>
