    <p>On Thursday 16th November 1989, a sixteen-year-old took guard in his first innings for India and faced one of the most feared bowling attacks in the world. He was dismissed by fellow debutant Waqar Younis for 15, but everyone knew that there was something special about this schoolboy – the youngest ever test cricketer at the time.</p>

<p>24 years later to the day, this ‘little genius’ gave a 25 minute farewell speech to the crowd at his home ground in Mumbai, talking about how “it is hard to believe that this wonderful journey has come to an end”. In light of cricketing legend Sachin Tendulkar’s retirement Felix takes a look at his ten best innings in an India shirt.</p>

<ol>
<li>114 v Australia
Perth 1992</li>
</ol>

<p>Tendulkar, on his first tour of Australia, was fast running out of partners as India slumped to 159-8 in Perth (known as one of the bounciest pitches in the world). The Australian bowling attack was looking forward to exposing a major weakness in Sachin Tendulkar’s game by bouncing him out. But he responded in a way nobody could have imagined. His innings of 114 from 161 balls gave India a fighting chance (which they ultimately wasted), and gave the world a clue of what might be to come.</p>

<ol>
<li>155 v Australia
Chennai 1998</li>
</ol>

<p>This innings was one of the famous battles that took place between Tendulkar and Shane Warne over the years. When Tendulkar arrived at the crease, India were 47 runs behind and two wickets down. Shane Warne was in his element, bowling on a fourth day Indian pitch with a lot of rough on the leg side. Under pressure, Tendulkar launched into one of the best counter-attacking innings anyone has ever played, frequently slog-sweeping Warne into the stands. When India declared later in the day, Tendulkar was not out on 155 and had helped India to a match winning lead of 347.</p>

<ol>
<li>146 v South Africa
Cape Town 2011</li>
</ol>

<p>Tendulkar had already scored one century in the series – his fiftieth – but this was by far and away the more important one. India were level at 1-1 and aiming for an improbable series draw on the green and bouncy pitches of South Africa. India were 28-2 in response to South Africa’s 362 and were in trouble – especially considering the low scores that both sides had presented in the series thus far. Against an impressive Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel, Tendulkar racked up 146. Tendulkar then scored a patient 14 from 91 balls on day five to save the test, the series and India’s status as number one in the world. This would turn out to be Tendulkar’s last test century.</p>

<ol>
<li>119 v England
Old Trafford 1991</li>
</ol>

<p>Chasing a near impossible 408 to win the game, India slumped to 127-5, and even saving the game looked unlikely. A seventeen-year-old Tendulkar then shocked everyone as he produced a performance with great character, scoring his first test century and saving the game for India – against all odds.</p>

<ol>
<li>143 v Australia
Sharjah 1998</li>
</ol>

<p>Australia’s target for India of 284 was largely irrelevant in this game. The more important figure was that of 250 (adjusted after a sandstorm mid-game), which is what India needed to book a place in the final on net run rate (Australia had already qualified). On a tough pitch – and Shane Warne bowling – Tendulkar produced a master class, scoring at more than a run a ball to lead India to the final.</p>

<ol>
<li>241 v Australia
Sydney 2004</li>
</ol>

<p>This innings could almost be thought of as the resurrection of Tendulkar’s career (although that might be a bit over the top). Tendulkar had endured a miserable 2003, scoring only 150 runs all season. The rumblings had started – maybe Tendulkar was past his prime? Tendulkar proved them wrong in the New Year’s test in 2004, scoring 241 not out as India racked up 705. His next two innings were 61 not out in the second innings, and 194 not out in the first test against Pakistan. He wasn’t dismissed in 2004 until April 5th. Tendulkar was back to his scintillating best.</p>

<ol>
<li>98 v Pakistan
Centurion 2003</li>
</ol>

<p>It may seem strange that one of Tendulkar’s best innings isn’t a century – especially given he has 100 of them – but the reality is that even Tendulkar thinks this was his best innings, period. There was a lot of hype surrounding the last group stage match – India and Pakistan had not played each other in more than three years. Chasing 274, Tendulkar famously destroyed Shoaib Akhtar in his first over, and went on to score 98 in 75 balls, despite suffering from cramp. Fireworks went off in India after the match – not because India had qualified for the next round, not because of the result, but because Tendulkar had single-handedly knocked arch-rivals Pakistan out of the World Cup in the first round.</p>

<ol>
<li>200 v South Africa
Gwalior 2010</li>
</ol>

<p>It was only fitting that the first person to score 200 in One-Day-Internationals was the leading run scorer in the form of the game. Already leading 1-0 in a three match series, Tendulkar batted serenely through the entire 50 overs, scoring his 200th run in the last over. India went on to take the series 2-1. To put it into context, Tendulkar only batted one other time in the series, scoring 4. He was still named man of the series.</p>

<ol>
<li>103 v England
Chennai 2008</li>
</ol>

<p>When people remember this innings they’ll also remember the circumstances that surrounded it. The <sup>26</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> terrorist attacks had just taken place in Mumbai, and this match had had to be hastily rearranged and moved to Chennai from Mumbai. Tendulkar, a Mumbai man, had appeared in many advertisements in the lead up to the match telling the Indian people to stick together. On the pitch, India had been behind the 8-ball for the first four days of the match. But as usual Tendulkar came to the rescue. Chasing 387 to win (the third highest chase ever at the time), Tendulkar reached his hundred while hitting the winning runs. The commentator’s words, “Make no mistake about it, this is for Mumbai” could not have been more apt.</p>

<ol>
<li>134 v Australia
Sharjah 1998</li>
</ol>

<p>If his previous innings in Sharjah was great (see 6), then this performance that Tendulkar produced two days later in the final could only be classed as sensational. By this time Tendulkar was clearly causing Shane Warne nightmares (he also scored a century against them in the ICC Champions Trophy later in the year, along with the ones in 9 and 6), as he again swatted him away. Chasing a target of 273 to win, Tendulkar led India to victory scoring 134 from 131 balls.</p>
