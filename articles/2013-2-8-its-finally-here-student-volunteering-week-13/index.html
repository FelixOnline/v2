<p>Students – other than being the drunken, lazy, selfish creatures we’re perceived to be by all those people with real jobs – are also an amazing resource. We are young, healthy (hopefully), intelligent people with a massive capacity to bring about real change.</p>

<p>Next week is <a href="http://www.volunteering.org.uk/policy-and-campaigns/student-volunteering-week">Student Volunteering Week</a>; a national week brought to you by NUS and your very own Imperial Hub aimed at celebrating the enormous contribution that student volunteers make to their communities across the country, and inspiring the next generation of student volunteers.</p>

<p>I can hear what’s going through your head already – I don’t have time for this. And I’m not pretending that everyone has limitless free time to spend volunteering. I know that Imperial’s timetable is pretty horrendous. Some of us effectively have full time jobs with 9am to 5pm days, as well as social lives, maybe we play sport, there’s so much good TV at the moment…and we enjoy sleep – so where does volunteering fit in? For most of us, it doesn’t. This article will hopefully convince you that it really, really should.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can hear what’s going through your head already – I don’t have time for this</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For those of you that have already pondered this topic, have decided that it’s not for you, and are thinking about flipping straight to the centrefold&hellip;Please visit this website: www.sparked.com to find out about micro-volunteering. Here, 20minutes or an hour of your time can truly make a difference. The “Sparked” platform involves matching a “request” from a charity or individual to a pool of potential “solvers” – the micro-volunteers.</p>

<p>For everyone else, read on to find out why I think we should all volunteer.</p>

<p>Discover your passionate side</p>

<p>Spending the afternoon in an old people’s home listening to a woman with a beard repeating the story of her son’s birth 20 times might be someone’s idea of heaven… but maybe it’s not yours. When you volunteer, you have to find a cause or organisation that you feel genuinely moved and motivated by. You will be in a much better position to learn something, to make an actual difference, and have an impact on those you’re helping if you’re doing something that you care about.</p>

<p>It’s a 2-way street</p>

<p>Volunteering undoubtedly leaves you with that warm tingly feeling that comes with doing a truly good deed. So, even though the primary aim of volunteering should be to help someone, or a cause, you ultimately help yourself too. Volunteering does and should benefit both the cause AND the volunteer – it’s about doing good for others as well as for yourself. Before you volunteer, think about how you are going to help, and also ask yourself “what am I going to gain from this experience?” Whether it’s developing skills, meeting people, or just the warm tingly feeling…(mmm)</p>

<p>Networking</p>

<p>It may seem superficial and contradictory, but networking is incredibly important – not just for corporations; not just for marketing and making a profit, but also for individuals, and for innovation. Volunteering is another way to meet a whole range of people from totally different backgrounds and walks of life. Keeping an open mind and understanding other people’s perspectives is essential to our future development. The people you meet volunteering, whether it’s fellow volunteers or the head of an NGO, could one day help you to realise your ambitions. Volunteering can also supply you with references for job and internship applications. Even without the reference, research by Reed employment found that 73% employers would hire candidates who had volunteered over those who hadn’t.</p>

<p>Don’t a be slave of circumstance</p>

<p>How easy is it…You spend all day in lectures and labs, maybe do a stint in the Library, eat some dinner…you eventually have a chance to relax – what do you do? Hang out with friends? Watch an episode of something with some really good looking people in it? And then bed. And the same thing the next day. And the one after. Wake up!</p>

<p>Every now and then we need something new; a fresh perspective to really shake up our routine and to push us in a different direction. When you volunteer, you constantly find yourself in new and occasionally uncomfortable situations, and you deal with them. You become more comfortable with taking risks and putting yourself out there, and you grow as a person. You learn something about yourself too, maybe a talent you didn’t know you possessed, a career path you hadn’t considered&hellip;</p>

<p>There are many, many more reasons why you should volunteer. But really, you just have to give it a go – I bet you won’t look back.</p>

<p>For some more inspiration, read on for some examples of the great opportunities that exist here at Imperial.</p>

<h2 id="great-opportunities-that-you-can-get-involved-in">Great opportunities that you can get involved in&hellip;</h2>

<p>Student Action for Refugees</p>

<p>Student Action for Refugees (STAR) at Imperial is part of a national network of students working to improve the lives of asylum seekers and refugees in the UK though volunteering and campaigning projects. Students from Nottingham University originally founded STAR 20 years ago, and the STAR network now consists of 34 university groups – student volunteering at its best.</p>

<p>Interact</p>

<p>If you’re not sure you can make a regular commitment, Interact is the society for you. They organise a variety of one-off, student-led volunteer projects in the local community around Imperial. Past opportunities include helping out at homeless shelters, visiting museums with the elderly and conservation projects.</p>

<p>Imperial Paediatrics</p>

<p>Imperial Paediatrics is an incredibly popular new initiative involving students from Imperial visiting patients in the paediatric ward at St. Mary’s hospital, dedicating their time to making inpatients’ stays as happy as possible.</p>

<p>Talk to me London</p>

<p>As part of Student Volunteering Week, LSE, UCL and Imperial are launching a collaborative project – “Talk to me London”. Thisstudent-led campaign aims to tackle the issue of social isolation by getting Londoners to talk to each other – on campus, on the tube… everywhere! Badges saying “Talk to me London” along with cards with conversation starters have been designed and will be distributed throughout the week – get yours at the JCR on Wednesday 13th, or come along to the Talk to me London pub quiz on Thursday! This project will hopefully embolden students to engage with their local community, and also create a great platform to discuss the power and impact of student volunteering.</p>

<p>I truly believe that the value of volunteering, and the attitude that surrounds it – one of respect, generosity and open-mindedness – cannot be underestimated. The point is: if you are volunteering your time for a cause or organisation that you feel genuinely passionate about, you don’t begrudge this time spent: you want to be there!</p>

</blockquote>

<p>We are students at an incredibly academically intense university – but also one that values innovation and interdisciplinary, creative research. It is important for us to get out of our comfort zone every now and again, to reassess our priorities and perspectives. To stay creative! Get out there and make a genuine difference. Learn something about yourself. Learn something about people. Become a better person. Spend your time IMPROVING A SITUATION. Imagine how well you’re going to sleep at night… and all this – for free.</p>

<p>Student Volunteering Week is the perfect opportunity to get involved. To see the diversity of opportunities there are out there, and to understand why the volunteering should play a more central role in all of our lives. And if you’re too busy next week, drop us an email or come in for a chat at the Imperial Hub. You never know… you might end up feeling just as passionate about student volunteering, and about the capacity of student volunteers to make things happen, as we do.</p>

<p>My name is Jez. I’m studying Electrical and Electronic Engineering. I am currently taking part in Pimlico Connection, an award-winning peer-tutoring scheme, as a classroom assistant. My job is to answer questions from year 7 students during maths lessons. I chose to do it because it seemed to be an interesting job and it is really rewarding when you can answer their questions and help them with their studies. You feel like you actually make a difference in the classroom as the students get more help and learn more. I would definitely recommend this.</p>

<p>I’m Dill, and I volunteer for the Schools Plus program. It’s been a great way to provide the extra help that so many school pupils need to succeed in their exams and beyond. I’ve been helping out in a GCSE Maths class at Bishop Challoner School in East London. They really value the tuition that they wouldn’t otherwise receive. They are set to get at least C grades in GCSE Maths, but with our help we hope to unleash their true potential and achieve A grades! It is extremely rewarding work that only takes an hour or two each week. When the students have a ‘penny drop moment’ it is really worth it!</p>

<p>I’m Michael and I volunteer at e.quinox, which is an Imperial based student led organisation aiming to find the blueprint solution to rural electrification in development countries. I am in the technical and marketing team and it’s so much fun! Not only I get to know other people outside my course, learn some new skills and also help others who are less fortunate than us! I love it so much that I’m even helping to organise Student Volunteering Week, hoping more people will spend their time volunteering!!</p>

<p>I am Jacqueryn, a 1st year Chem Eng. I’m in charge of free instrument taster sessions in collaboration with Imperial Chamber Music Society and also some activities for Student Volunteering Week on Valentine’s Day. I’ve also joined several volunteering projects locally and overseas. I volunteer because there is no reason for me not doing so! I learn something new from every volunteering opportunity and also come to appreciate what I have in life. I would recommend volunteering for the experiences and sense of achievement that you gain.</p>
