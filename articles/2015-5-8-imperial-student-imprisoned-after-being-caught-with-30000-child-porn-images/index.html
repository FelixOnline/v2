    <p>A third year mathematics student has been sentenced to 18 months in jail after 30,000 images of child pornography were found on his laptop.</p>

<p>Nur Fitri Azmeer Nordin, 23, from Malaysia, was caught by police with his laptop open and next to a life-size mannequin of a boy last November, in his own home in Queensborough Terrace, near Hyde Park.</p>

<p>He was also found guilty of making and then distributing further indecent images that have been described by officers as “some of the most extreme images that have ever seen by officers that work in that field”.</p>

<p>All devices were seized from the property and searched, with many of the files recovered considered as Category A material, meaning it depicted the most extreme forms of abuse.</p>

<p>Nordin pleaded guilty to a total of 17 counts in front of the Southwark Crown Court last Thursday, after remaining in custody since his house raid back in November.</p>

<p>Nordin pleaded guilty to one count of possessing a total of 235 indecent videos, and one count of possessing a total of 921 of indecent images and videos specifically of children.</p>

<p>He pleaded to two counts of making images of children and four counts of possessing images of children with intent to distribute them further.</p>

<p>He also pleaded guilty to five counts of taking indecent photographs of a child.</p>

<p>Classmates reported that Nordin “suddenly” disappeared during the Autumn term and said they were shocked when he reappeared in the news earlier this week.</p>

<p>Said one on a Facebook post: “there were no signs of odd behaviour, he had a full attendance record and was a top student. I couldn’t spot anything wrong.”</p>

<p>They also told Felix since the conviction has been made public: “He had a good sense of humour&hellip; all in all he was a great guy.</p>

<p>“I’m equally shocked as other people to find out about his crime…[but] hopefully he’ll get treated and I hope for the best for him.”</p>

<p>Police were alerted to an internet account in the area that was downloading thousands of sexual abuse images and videos. After identifying the student, they raided the property and found Nordin in his bedroom in front of his laptop, sitting next to the child mannequin.</p>

<p>DC Sara Keane, from the Metropolitan’s Serious Crime Unit said: “This appalling case demonstrates the danger some adults pose to young and vulnerable children.</p>

<p>“Those who download this material, and then distribute to others, are fuelling the demand and creating yet more defenceless victims.</p>

<p>“The Metropolitan Police works tirelessly to bring those responsible to justice and we urge anyone with information about similar crimes to come forward and speak to us.”</p>

<p>The Inspector-General of Police (IGP) in Malaysia, Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar, has said to Malaysian press that the police do treat such offences with serious concern, but that: “Paedophilia is not so noticeable a crime in this country but we do monitor and take it seriously.”</p>

<p>According to UK news sources, Nordin will serve 18 months in prison in the UK, although immediately after his release he will be deported back to Malaysia. However, he may be eligible for deportation after completing only two thirds of his sentence.</p>

<p>Despite this sentence, Malaysia’s Ministry of Rural and Regional Development has stated it is considering appealing to the Southwark Crown court in London to get him out sooner.</p>

<p>The Malaysian Attorney-General has refused to comment what Nordin’s punishment would have been if Nordin had been convicted in his home country.</p>

<p>However, the Child Act 2001 in Malaysia makes it an offence to sexually abuse a child by forcing them to take part in the creation of pornography.</p>

<p>Those caught committing such an offence is liable for a jail term of up to ten years and a maximum fine of RM20,000 (approximately £3,600), or both, according to the Malay Mail online.</p>

<p>Nordin was attending Imperial on a Majlis Amanah Rakyat (MARA) scholarship, meaning that his tuition was paid for by a Malaysian government agency formed to support those from rural backgrounds.</p>

<p>Upon his conviction, MARA has since terminated his study allowance and have stated that they will be expecting him to pay the full sum of money allocated to him back.</p>

<p>Nordin would have received £22,950 a year for tuition costs, but it is unknown if he was provided with living allowance too.</p>

<p>However, a member of the MARA council has since said that Nordin “deserves a second chance,” and will be welcome back to study at any MARA institution upon his release.</p>

<p>Nazir Hussin Akhtar Hussin, one of the MARA council members, has said to Malaysian newspaper mStar, a Malaysian news outlet: “We will support him in any way possible to help him rebuild his character and one way is to give him a chance to study in any MARA institution.”</p>

<p>“Any individual who repents for a mistake should be given a second chance after being punished, especially among gifted students who can become national assets.</p>

<p>“He is a smart student and it would be a waste not to help someone who can be an asset to the country.”</p>

<p>A spokesperson from Imperial College told Felix: “The College confirms that Mr Nur Azmeer Nordin was a third year mathematics student.</p>

<p>Mr Nordin had been on interruption of studies since December 2014.</p>

<p>“On 30 April 2015 he was found guilty of a number of charges relating to images of child abuse.</p>

<p>“The College has terminated the student’s registration in line with the relevant policy and he is not permitted to return.”</p>

<p>Nordin graduated in 2009 from a residential school in the State of Perak, Malaysia, before commencing his studies at Imperial in October 2012.</p>

<p>Malaysia reacts: “How do we not know he acted on his fetish?”</p>

<p>Malaysian news outlets are discussing little else other than Nordin’s conviction, with many politicians, organisations and prominent members of society coming forward and giving their views.</p>

<p>Many have taken to Twitter to voice their disgust over a MARA council member reportedly saying that Nordin would be allowed to continue studying in Malaysia upon his return.</p>

<p>A petition has since been launched named “Demand MARA to stop giving a paedophile a second chance,” which has amassed over 5,800 signatures. The petition asks: “since when is a paedophile a national asset?” and also demands: “How do we know that he did not act on his fetish?”</p>

<p>The hashtag #NoSecondChance was popular on twitter in Malaysia earlier in the week.</p>

<p>Others have been discussing the potential for Nordin to be rehabilitated and released back into the community, although most are unhappy about the idea.</p>

<p>Noor Farida, the co-ordinator of a group of Malaysian civil servants released in a statement that Nordin needs to receive “treatment” until he has been “completely cured.”</p>

<p>“Otherwise, from mere possession of paedophile porn, he might graduate to physically acting out his sexual fantasies and pose a real danger to children,” she added.</p>

<p>“Nur Fitri Azmeer is obviously a pervert and for MARA to make excuses for his actions is totally repugnant and unacceptable. Sadly, MARA seems to have lost its moral compass.”</p>

<p>Dr Hartini Zainudin, managing director and one of the founders of the Malaysian Yayasan Chow Kit, a 24-hour crisis centre for children, said sexual predators have a “disease that you don’t get cured from.”</p>

<p>Zainudin said that much like other addictions, sexual predators need constant supervision and counselling.</p>

<p>“Show me he’s repented, has his emotions under control and demonstrates that he’s done good for the community, then we’ll talk? In the meantime, he’s not coming within ten feet of any child I know.”</p>

<p>Women’s Centre for Change (WCC) advocacy officer, Joshua Teh, also pointed out that “There are currently no laws which makes it mandatory for such offenders to undergo therapy and rehabilitation, or for regular therapy and monitoring once they have been released from imprisonment.</p>

<p>“Such provisions should be put in place in order to allow for the safe reintegration of persons who have committed such offences into society,” Teh said.</p>

<p>Protect and Save The Children, a Malaysian organisation focussing on the prevention, intervention and treatment of sexual abuse towards children, has also spoken to the Malaysian press about the case.</p>

<p>The organisation’s President, Datin Che Nariza Hajjar Hashim said that Malaysia does not have a “sound rehabilitation centre” for sex offenders and paedophiles.</p>

<p>“We don’t have enough study here on how they offended, when they are a risk, to whom they are a risk, the warning signs of risk to support the police and probation officers to better manage them in the community here in Malaysia. We do not have specialised expertise here in Malaysia,” she told Malay Mail Online.</p>

<p>However, the Foreign Affairs Minister for Malaysia, Datuk Seri Anifah Aman said on Thursday that he favoured setting up a public register of convicted paedophiles, that would hopefully act as a deterrent. He also stressed that those abroad should not feel that if convicted, the government would step in to save them.</p>

<p>“I wish to state unequivocally that Malaysia views this matter gravely. We do not condone these acts particularly as they are considered as crime against young children.</p>

<p>“I also wish to stress that Malaysian students have a duty to focus on their studies and to uphold the good name and image of the country.</p>

<p>“Malaysian students as well as citizens are expected to abide by the laws of the countries in which they are domiciled.”</p>
