    <p>When it comes to theatre, London is an international capital of excellence. Some would argue it offers the best of the best when it comes to high quality cultural performances. While many have fallen under the spell of the big musicals and gripping plays, always yearning for their next chance to get their West End fix, others don’t see the hype, thinking it tacky, overpriced and “not for me”. Breaking down these stereotypes and showing that there truly is something for everyone is important to ensure this art form remains accessible to all. What better way to do this than by exploring four very different, hugely successful musicals that you can go and see today on the West End?</p>

<p>For little more than a cinema ticket, you could find yourself in the seat of an iconic West End musical. Though movies have their charm, there is something very special about seeing a performance live. Familiar songs are belted out right in front of your eyes – no lip-syncing here! – and the sheer number of people is stupendous, from actors and the live band, to lighting technicians and even the understudies, ensuring that the show goes on every night. To add to the drama of it all, the beautiful old theatres in which the performance take place will make you feel like you’re a member of the bourgeoisie, even if you only paid a tenner for your ticket! Here are four very different musicals to give you a flavour for what’s on&hellip;</p>

<p><strong><em>Aladdin</em></strong></p>

<p>This Disney classic made its West End debut in June 2016 and continues to wow endearingly eager adult Disney aficionados and younger fans alike. Set in Agrabah, a city of wonder, genies and countless stereotypes, the story is at its heart one of social mobility. It proves than anyone can go from rags to rich if, like Aladdin, you find a magical genie and marry a beautiful princess. The plot is hardly the <em>raison d’etre</em> for this production, but it definitely has other strengths.</p>

<p>The opening of the performance is underwhelming. Despite an innovative set, with swivelling housing and minarets, these first scenes fail to capture the essence of the hustle and bustle of the market scene from the movie. However, the genie, played by Trevor Dion Nicholas from the original Broadway cast, saves the day with an electric performance of ‘Friend Like Me’. Providing high-energy comedic relief, he drops in references to everything from Wakanda, <em>Beauty and the Beast,</em> and of course the Christina Aguilera classic, ‘Genie in a Bottle’.</p>

<p>The sets, costume and choreography are the forte of this show. During a couple of songs, no less than ten costume changes could be counted! With a backdrop dripping with gold, actors parade in dressed like Vegas showgirls, before reappearing moments later as tap dancers straight out of 42nd Street. In the palace, the geometric Islamic art-styled walls add a level of elegance and simplicity to a show that at times seem a little ostentatious. To top it all off, the magic carpet flying through an enchanting starry sky leaves the entire audience in awe. The only downside of this magical moment is that the carpet rather steals the show, leaving the greatly anticipated ‘A Whole New World’ something of an afterthought.</p>

<p><em>-3 stars</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Wicked</em></strong></p>

<p><img src="https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/felixonline/2018_felix_issues/issue_1715/1715_arts_WestEnd_Wicked.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you remember that <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> first came to cinemas everywhere in the summer of 1939, you probably never thought a sequel would be possible&hellip; until now! <em>Wicked</em> focuses on the backstory of the two main witches, Glinda (The Good Witch) and Elphaba, more commonly known as the Wicked Witch of the West. Lots of old characters and top Oz locations are back but the tone of this story is very different – and yet it instantly feels like a classic. The central question – “Are people born wicked or do they have wickedness thrust upon them?” – is explored with a clear moral argument organically emerging in a way that doesn’t feel forced in the slightest.</p>

<p>If you know anything about Broadway, the West End, musical theatre or if you’ve ever watched Glee, you will have definitely heard the song ‘Defying Gravity’. Originally performed by the legendary Idina Menzel, it is brought to life on the West End stage by Alice Fearn who takes it to new heights. This song comes at such a climatic point, it makes Everest look like a mere hill and, without wanting to give away too much, a certain greenified witch might just defy gravity (just a little)!</p>

<p>Being a faraway land – outside Zone 2 most probably – Oz must live up to its weird and wonderful credentials. During a little weekend trip to the Emerald City, the locals are dressed like they came straight out of the Capitol from <em>The Hunger Games,</em> just a little greener. The costumes of the main characters, Glinda and Elphaba in particular, are what you would expect; no bells or whistles, but the simplicity lends itself well to these classic characters which many would have first met in the beloved story <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>.</p>

<p><em>-5 stars</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Les Misérables</em></strong></p>

<p>If you’ve ever had a bad day and wondered how things can ever get worse, now you have the answer: <em>Les Misérables</em>. Inspired by the 2012 movie which was itself inspired by this musical, this production of <em>Les Mis</em> portrays the grit, gore and miserableness of life in 19th century France. If you have read the original books by Victor Hugo from the 19th Century, you probably don’t have a much of a clue what is going on in this notoriously confusing plot. The story follows Jean Valjean, a convict on the run who wants a clean slate. After the death of one of his factory workers, Fantine, he agrees to take her daughter Cosette under his care. To really make sure the story of the orphaned girl whose mother died due to an unfortunate foray into prostitution is miserable enough, it is all set during the June rebellion. This battle sees many characters meet their fate on a poetically staged battle on the barricades where scores of bodies are left to rest.</p>

<p>If it wasn’t already clear, this is no fairy tale and thus the production focuses on epic singing and minimal but effective set design. The whole set revolves around a spinning stage, like a giant record player. The intelligent partial lighting of the stage mean that tables, chairs and other props can simply appear and disappear as the stage spins. There are no big costume changes or huge sets, mostly due to the fact that 19th century France was quite uniform in its gloominess. This means that transitions between scenes can take place very quickly and allow for a continuous and dynamic story. Like the turbulent life of the characters, the audience is never given a chance to rest.</p>

<p>With no fanfare to hide behind, performers are left alone on stage, and their raw talent is put to the test. No musical has such a wealth of songs which conjure up such emotion; every note hits home. A few notable songs are ‘On My Own’ and ‘I Dreamed a Dream’, some of the most well recognized songs in all of musical theatre. Being the world’s longest running musical and now in its 34th year, some of the actors today were not even born when the original cast took stage – quite the legacy to uphold. This can be daunting, but all the actors bring something different to their respective roles making it a musical to see time and time again.</p>

<p><em>-5 stars</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Everybody&rsquo;s Talking About Jamie</em></strong></p>

<p>If you are tired of unelected Broadway bureaucrats influencing the artistry of the West End and want to take back control, <em>Everybody’s Talking About Jamie,</em> a British-born musical proudly set in Sheffield, is the show for you! Based on the 2011 BBC Three documentary <em>Jamie: Drag Queen at 16,</em> it follows a young 16-year-old boy who wanted to go to his prom in drag.</p>

<p>The musical explores the reactions of those around him including his mother, father and other classmates as he embarks on a journey of drag discovery. It is in many ways a queer story, but it is also a story of acceptance, making the themes universal. As Sheffield seems to have more in common with 19th century France than Agrabah or Oz, there is not much room for magical set designs.</p>

<p>Instead, it is the story and characters which captivate the audience and provide the strong Northern spirit.</p>

<p>Although some aspects of the musical seem a little ordinary, the choreography is very fun and adds to a feel-good factor. Other shows and storytellers should take notes from <em>Everybody’s Talking About Jamie</em> with regards to diversity. While in other shows, diversity is having a token minority character, in this musical, there are two Muslim girls who are very different, breaking down any preconceptions the audience might have associated with them. This musical is definitely the kind of show for someone who isn’t interested in the familiar stories of <em>Les Mis</em> or <em>Aladdin,</em> but wants something fresh!</p>

<p><em>-4 stars</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Cast Member to Watch&hellip; Lucie Shorthouse in</em> Everybody’s Talking About Jamie</strong></p>

<p><em>This British born actress plays the part of Pritti, Jamie’s best friend. Her standout solo during ‘It Means Beautiful’ shows the potential that she has. Her voice is spectacular – of course, in a West End musical you expect amazing voices, but hers is truly a cut above the rest. As part of a big new cast at the end of January, she left the production and it is not yet certain what her next project will be, but after an amazing run in this production and winning a ‘WhatsOnStage Award’ for Best Supporting Actress in a Musical, she is definitely one to watch!</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Top Tips: Cheap Tickets</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Whenever doing any kind of booking, look up promo codes – there may be a few extra quid to be saved!</em></p>

<p><em>Lots of shows have daily lotteries – enter for free (every day if you wish) and only pay if you win!</em> Hamilton <em>tickets for £10 anyone? Find these on individual box office websites.</em></p>

<p>TodayTix <em>is an amazing app for getting the best deals. It offers lotteries for front row seats at bargain prices as well as many, many other deals. If you don’t mind being last minute, keep them on notifications and you’ll be the first to know when the prices are slashed!</em></p>

<p><em>Look out for big West End sales and make sure to compare the sale price with the original price (straight from the box office) to make sure you are getting good value for money.</em></p>

<p><em>Finally, use seatplan.com to make sure that the seats you have are worth it; discounted seats can often be ones with restricted viewing. If you don’t mind though, you can save a lot of money!</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Top Tips: At the Show</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Most evening performances start at 19:30 but it is good to arrive at least 15-20 minutes beforehand as there can be queues.</em></p>

<p><em>The performances last for about 2h30  with a 15 minute interval for you to buy overpriced snacks, or</em></p>

<p><em>&hellip;Bring in your own snacks and drinks! (Just make sure it isn’t too obtrusive!)</em></p>
