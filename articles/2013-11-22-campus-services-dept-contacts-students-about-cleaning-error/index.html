    <p>Last week Felix reported on College Campus Services’ decisions to change the campus cleaning services during a re-tendering of the cleaning contract. It transpired that one of the department’s decisions included reducing the frequency of cleaning in bedrooms and communal areas, at one stage justifying this by explaining this had enabled the potential more frequent cleaning of other areas such as Ethos and the Library Café.</p>

<p>However, many students in halls have been upset by the way in which the changes were handled, in particular the mistakes make with the accommodation licence. Even though the decisions may have been signed during Summer, because Campus Services neglected to update the contract, many students feel as though they have signed up for a more frequent cleaning service than they currently receive.</p>

<p>After our article on Friday, residents received a better explanation of the situation from Campus Services via email this Tuesday. The email is replicated (as is) below:
<em>“Dear Hall Residents,
 This summer the College-wide cleaning contract was re-tendered for the first time in over seven years. As a result, we now receive a more specific and flexible service for the same cost. In response to feedback from students, Campus Services used this opportunity to make changes to the cleaning services provided in halls of residence as well as across other College facilities that we operate for students and staff. These changes were not made to cut costs and we will always aim to provide a high standard of cleaning to our residents.</em></p>

<p><em>The changes:
 Bedrooms are cleaned once a month and more thoroughly. Kitchens are now cleaned three days per week, including once on a Saturday. The bins still continue to be emptied daily and recycling bins are emptied according to local council collection rotas (usually 3-4 times per week).
 Following these changes we have been consulting with Imperial College Union on how else to improve hall cleaning provisions. As a result we are in the process of making cleaning equipment readily available in every hall and we encourage students to make use of them as and when required. Information posters in every kitchen will inform students of their location and will include details on local arrangements for cleaning and bin collection.
 All of the changes are being monitored and we will shortly be conducting a review in co-operation with Imperial College Union and halls committees to ensure the current service is adequate. Our priority is providing an effective cleaning service and we will continue to modify the service where this is not the case.</em></p>

<p><em>There has been some concern over the College Accommodation Licence (2013-2014) which includes details of the previous cleaning arrangements in halls. Because of tight timescales, the clause referring to these arrangements was not amended, however this was a genuine error. We apologise for not contacting you earlier about these changes.
 The Accommodation Licence is rarely changed ? and before there are any changes in the future Campus Services will work closely with the Vice-Provost (Education), the Director of Student Support and Imperial College Union to establish the best approach for consultation and to ensure any changes are effectively communicated to students&hellip;.”</em></p>

<p>While the Campus Services department has admitted to making an error while handling the cleaning contract, for many students this last message leaves so many questions unanswered. There has still been no mention of the legality of continuing the current cleaning service, given that the Accommodation License that binds halls residents and College states that rooms will be cleaned weekly instead of monthly.</p>

<p>However, a positive note in this issue has been that during consultation with the Union, Campus Services has decided to make cleaning equipment more accessible to all students (as of the above email) and plan to give students a greater amount of information about the equipment and the cleaning services amount halls.</p>

<p>This is a step in the right direction, however Campus Services does not seem to have acknowledged the inconvenience that has been caused to students so far, including the state some residents’ rooms have reached while not able to access cleaning equipment available for student use.</p>

<p>Last week Felix posed several questions to Campus Services that have yet to be answered, including asking for more information about the student feedback that was consulted when making the decision to reduce bedroom cleaning frequency (especially in relation to how many students took part in the feedback and how many strongly wished to have their rooms cleaned less often). Felix also asked about how students had been actively consulted during the decision making (as significant stakeholders) and whether the department had considered the effects less frequently cleaned rooms might have in attracting pests.</p>

<p>Felix still awaits a response from Campus Services on these issues, as well as further clarification on the legal aspect on the decision.</p>

<p>If you have been affected by the changes to cleaning in halls, or hold any strong views on the subject, send a letter to the Editor at felix@ic.ac.uk.</p>

            Come on Felix- stand up to commercial (sorry Campus) services...we are a College NOT a company. CS is ran by someone who has no concern about the long term impact of their decisions- short term profit is considered a success for this part of our organization. ,We should all not pay next term, and send them an email explaining we made a minor error in agreeing to the contract, neglecting to inform them a recent change meant we wouldn't be paying. <br> <br>I'm not even that bothered, but worth it for a laugh?,It is regrettable that something like this happened, but are we annoyed simply that "the cleaning service has changed", or that the cleaning service has changed but "the license doesn't reflect the change"? <br> <br>I'm sure that if people are really upset about this the College will happily declare your license void and allow you to terminate your accommodation agreement with immediate effect... <br> <br>Failure to comply with a contract is simply an opportunity for the other party to renegotiate a new contract with respec
