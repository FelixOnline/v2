The Belly Dancing Society hosts weekly classes in Autumn & Spring Terms however, during the summer, due to many of our members having exams, we pause our courses in favour of workshops. These 2-hour sessions are designed to expand the horizons of our members, by introducing them to new sides of belly dancing, but are also suitable for beginners to the style, even if you’ve never danced before! Our summer workshop series this year kicks off with Polynesian Fusion Belly Dance next Friday.

We’ve invited Shaddy of the Fleur Estelle Dance School (FEDS) to give this workshop. The FEDS is a London-based belly dance school offering a range of classes, both in person and online. We hire their teachers to teach our traditional belly dancing classes, and we invited them to give one of our workshops when we found out about this fun new theme! If you’re interested in finding out more about FEDS, you can check out their website [www.fleurestelle.com](https://www.fleurestelle.com/) for more information.

Inspired by their recent travels to Rapa Nui (Easter Island), the FEDS has developed an Island Fusion workshop. It combines some of the belly dance classics from their syllabus with tropical moves and techniques to give unique fusion that creates sunshine in class! Rapa Nui is just one of the 1,000+ islands within Polynesia, and so they’ve drawn inspiration from many of the different dance styles across this archipelago. If that sounds like fun, join Shaddy next Friday and be immersed in that tropical feeling! 

We hope you’ll join us for this workshop – if you can’t make it but are still interested in learning to belly dance with us, we have a swords workshop on 21st May, a belly-hoop class on 4th June and a “vintage combos” tribal fusion workshop on 18th June. Email bellydancing@imperial.ac.uk for details!
