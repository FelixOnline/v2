An Imperial student with dreams of becoming a councillor was beaten by two Conservative candidates to join Kensington and Chelsea council.

The winners were Sarah Ann Louise Addenbrooke and Anne Barbara Cyron, who gained 1716 and 1470 votes respectively.

The final year physics student did come in at a noble third place though, getting 395 votes; a hundred more than the other Labour candidate.

The vote took place alongside the mayoral and London Assembly elections last Thursday, after the two Conservative council members decided to step down, triggering a by-election.

The Kensington and Chelsea turnout was a sad 46.4%.
