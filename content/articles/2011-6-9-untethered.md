Imagine: a flock of paper birds set free across the gallery,
 surging from out of one corner to disappear into another.
 Imagine: the tensions in the lines of string fastened to the ceiling,
 fixing, imprisoning their subjects.
 Imagine: a weightless bird, spinning helplessly on the end
 of a line, at once restrained and supported.

If only: the weights were greater, the tensions increased,
 then, only then, might these lines
 break
