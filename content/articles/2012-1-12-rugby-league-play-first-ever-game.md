Imperial played their first competitive fixture of the season against Woking College in what was a development fixture for both sides. Woking won 54-22 but it proved a fantastic experience for the new Imperial team.

The first half was very competitive with Imperial’s Padhraic Comerford, later named man of the match, opening the scoring with an early try. Tries followed from scrum half Jack Neil and hooker Stephen Dias but the fitness and experience of the Woking side proved decisive in the second half. A number of breakaway tries and crucial lapses in concentration cost Imperial the chance of a win in their first game.
 Darren Pugsley, Imperial Head coach, said: “It was a vital that they got some game time under their belts. We have a lot of lads new to rugby so we needed to get them into a game situation. Woking College are an experienced and talented outfit and fitted the bill perfectly.”

Imperial President, David Hobson, was upbeat after the game commenting: “Despite the score line this was a relatively evenly matched fixture and has given some of our young players the chance to experience rugby league. All of the players really enjoyed the fixture and we’re looking forward to getting back on the training field this week.” For more information or to get involved contact [rfl@imperial.ac.uk](mailto:rfl@imperial.ac.uk).
