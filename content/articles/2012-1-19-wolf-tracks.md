___Who’s who?___
__Ran: __I’m Ran, lead singer and I sometimes play acoustic guitar on some of the songs.
__Louie:__ I’m the drummer.
__Luke:__ I’m Luke, I play guitar.
__Henry: __Henry and I play the bass.

___So I heard you guys all met in halls?___
__Luke: __Yeah. We were all in Wilson last year. Me and Louis lived next door to each other and Ran lived sort of two doors down. We just sent an email around the hall and Henry said he played bass. Thankfully in Wilson there’s a practice room and it had a drum kit and stuff. It started out as just playing a bit and messing around in there.

___I remember late night jams in first year... in Orient, just going into the kitchen. The guy next door was never around.___
__Luke: __Yeah, good times.
__Ran: __Before Henry came in, after our first bassist had left, we used to just hum the breakdown to this one song.
__Luke: __We’d all just be like “Bum. Bum. Badumbum!”
__Ran: __Haha yeah doing the bass bit... it’s kind of sad. Then one day Henry came in and just absolutely ripped the bass apart!
__Louis: __It was just this quiet chap, who just comes in and...
__Ran: __Yeah, that was awesome.

___How long have you guys been together then?___
__Ran:__ We’re all second year now so...
__Henry:__ About a year.
__Luke: __We’ve only started gigging this year, cause last year we were just writing stuff. Last year was more just for fun, wasn’t it? I mean it still is, but like – it was more like just go down, have a practice, write some songs. And then at the end of last year we recorded a couple of songs... and it was just this year that we started sending it out.

___Was it for a demo or an EP?___
__Luke: __We recorded four songs and a cover. ‘Crossroads’ by Cream.
__Ran: __And ‘Brimful of Asha’.
__Luke: __Oh yeah, the Fatboy Slim version.
__Louis: __I think we recorded some of it in your room...

___To get gigs or just to pass around friends?___
__Luke: __Both really, ‘cause all the promoters we came across asked for something. All we had were rough recordings.
__Louis: __We had miked up a practice room but it didn’t sound that great.

___I used to record stuff on cassette, just ‘cause it’s the easiest way. Just press record and it’s done. You don’t have to worry about anything.___
__Ran: __It was handy though because you can listen back to it...

___So who came up with the band name?___
__Ran:__ We were originally called Romans which has more meaning just because our drinking room in Wilson was called Rome. And our house that we live in is called Rome 2... but it turns out there are already about 5 bands called the Romans, of varying success. Like someone in the 80s or the 70s...
__Luke: __It’s not very smart as well cause when you Google Romans you’ll get something about the Roman Empire.
__Ran: __So there’s a bike shop called Wolf Tracks near where I live in Scotland and I thought “that’s cool”.
__Louis:__ Bit random.

___So being Scottish I guess you appreciate the cold.___
__Ran:__ This winter was insane.

___Have you ever heard of arctic foxes?___
__Ran: __I think I’ve heard the name...

___They’re about the size of a housecat.___
__Ran:__ Oh I thought you meant a band!

___No, no, not the Arctic Monkeys! I read somewhere that they can withstand something like -70ºC. Some American scientists had to ‘borrow’ some and put them in a freezer cause they couldn’t figure it out. They didn’t even shiver.___
 Luke: You can’t even imagine something like that...

___I think your brain would freeze. So I heard some live songs on your SoundCloud...___
__Louis: __Yeah, my brother studied broadcasting at uni so he’s into film and all that. So we got him to come down and record it. We’ve got a few gigs now from the Uni Music League...

___Yeah, I remember some lady was handing out flyers for that during Fresher’s Fair... what’s that about?___
__Luke:__ It’s basically like a contest for artists and bands in London universities. I think there are about 40-odd bands. First round gigs are in the university and one band represents each one. In the second round, you play a gig at ULU, the University of London Union. We’re playing there on the 17th of February.

___That’s a nice venue.___
__Luke:__ Yeah, it’s really cool. There are 4 rounds, so just the semi-finals and the finals left after that.

___So what do you do? Fight each other with guitars? Who has the sharpest guitar?___
__Ran:__ Haha yeah - it could turn into that.
__Luke: __The winner gets an EP recorded by Charlie Hugall, who’s done Florence & the Machine and Kaiser Chiefs. But we’ve already met a promoter there who’s got us a gig at 93 Feet East and a couple at Proud Camden. We’ve just signed a contract so if we win they’re like, “we want to manage you”.

___Just don’t sign anything in blood.__
 “...Chicken burger!”_
__Luke:__ Sorry, I’m really hungry.
