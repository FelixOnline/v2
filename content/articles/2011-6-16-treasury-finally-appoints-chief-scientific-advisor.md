A Chief Scientific Advisor (CSA) has finally been appointed to the Treasury, previously the only remaining government department without a CSA. The position is being filled by James Richardson, who will retain his role as the Treasury’s director of public spending. CaSE director, Imran Khan, [applauded the move](http://sciencecampaign.org.uk/?p=5503) saying, “We desperately need someone within the department who can talk about how critical a long-term investment strategy for science and engineering is for the UK’s future.”
