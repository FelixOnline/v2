Sunday 8th February saw the Imperial Immortals clash with the Hertfordshire Hurricanes at Fortress Harlington.

Earlier in the season the Immortals put in a great second half and lost 22-12 after some inspired work from Bob WorksFromHomeAlone2:LostInNewYork with the quarterback sneak of legend.

Sunday’s game started with the Immortals offence on the pitch after a minute silence of respect for Tony Bainbridge, former head coach of Brighton Tsunami, who died earlier in the week.

The offence started strong; driving the ball early on, which would become a theme throughout the game. Strong running from Emanuel Olagbaju and Duncan ‘Wendy’ MacKinnon saw yards for days but as with previous games the offence struggled to finish and put the ball in the endzone.

Immortals defense were strong as ever and limited the normally high scoring Herts offence to only one touchdown in the first half, which ended with Amit Chawla getting a tasty interception.

The second half saw the Herts offence put up two more touchdowns and a field goal to put them up by 24-0. However, the Immortals stuck to what they knew by running the ball hard and throwing well.

Toby Sinclair, quarterback, threw for over 100 yards on the day including some great link-up play between Toby and Noach Ben-Haim with special mention for the always illusive yards-after-catch Noach managed to pick up, saw the Immortals fly down the pitch.

This megadrive saw the Immortals within 10 yards of the Herts endzone where the offence punched the ball in with a quarterback sneak with Toby waltzing in for the touchdown.

The defense managed to win the ball back for the offence several times through the efforts of Marin ‘wet burp’ Tuleu getting two interceptions on the day as well as Little Harry Collini causing a fumble.

However, the Herts defense stayed strong to deny the Immortals any more points and the game finished 24-6 to Herts.

The Game’s Most Valuable Players were: Little Harry ‘Springer’ Collini (Line MVP for great work on the offensive and defensive lines), Marin ‘wet burp’ Tuleu (Defensive MVP for consistent play of defense and getting two picks), Noach Ben-Haim (Offensive MVP for great play on the outside to keep the drive alive several times with his magic feet) and Jörn ‘Gorab’ Jörg (Overall MVP for dominating on both offensive and defensive lines and making the QB sneak a real weapon).

Special mention has to go Mad Dog Pecs who it was nice to see back playing the game with some of his mind intact.

A great performance with a unflattering score line help the Immortals to look forward to next week’s game against the Birmingham Lions.
