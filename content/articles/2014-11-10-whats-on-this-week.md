__Saturday, 1st November: MØ @ O2 Shepherd’s Bush Empire.__

You might have seen her supporting __AlunaGeorge__ last year and her debut album, _No Mythologies To Follow_, sees a collaboration with Diplo. Despite being fresh from a controversial performance with __Iggy Azealia__ on SNL, this is a chance to see __MØ __bring her alt-pop to a packed-out Empire in her own right..

__Monday, 1st November: Twin Atlantic @ The Roundhouse __

Screw the haters, if you want to see these Glaswegian rockers provide riffs and feels in equal measure, then you go ahead.

__Wednesday, 5th November:The War on Drugs @ The Roundhouse __

Adam Granduciel, the anti-frontman, leads his troupe in providing dreamy, sensitive alt-rock to an equally dreamy and sensitive crowd.

__Thursday, 6th November: The Knife @ Brixton Academy __

It’s official! They’re breaking up, and this is (almost) definitely their final UK performance. If you don’t fancy forking out for flights and tickets to the Icelandic music festival that will be their very last, this hedonistic night in Brixton is your best bet. If this really is goodbye, it should be a farewell to remember.

__Joanna Gruesome & Perfect Pussy @ The Dome Tufnell Park __

Don’t miss these firm friends in punk playing a riotous joint gig in Islington on Thursday. Tickets to this mosh-worthy evening of girl power are just a snip at £8.50.
