As Charity Week draws to an end, this Sunday marks the return of Smoky Not Smudgy (SnS); this is a flagship ladies only pampering event.
 SnS is run by the ladies for the ladies. All proceeds go towards the Charity Week campaign, ultimately helping orphans and needy children in the poorest parts of the world. Last year, over 400 ladies attended SnS and over £6000 was raised; this year it is even bigger and better. So make sure you don’t miss out.
 Hiba Saleem, one of the organisers of SnS commented: “Now in its 6th year, SnS is a ladies-only day of complete luxury services, beauty treatments, fashion boutiques, photography studios, a souk bazaar, master classes by skilled professionals, tutorials by industry experts and two show stopping fashion shows! Ladies, indulge yourselves guilt-free because all the money you pay to pamper yourself crazy will go straight to charity! This year the fashion shows will feature fifteen exciting designers with a show stopping collection”.
 There will also be celebrities doing master classes, beauty experts doing tutorials, as well as hairstylists, makeup artists and bloggers. There are many surprises in store too. The organisers have said you can “indulge in a makeover with a photo-shoot, relax with our professional masseuse, get your hands on the latest jewellery, clothes, accessories, hijabs and much more! Have your nails and henna done, pamper yourself with a facial, join in on our arabic art and cupcake classes! Find out more at www.facebook.com/smokynotsmudgy”
 Ruby Hakim has organised SnS three times in the past. She commented that “having attended the past 5 smoky not smugdy events, I can tell you first hand that its the most fun day in the calendar! The turnout is always impressive and the event content is even more impressive. Every year since its birth, SnS has reached new heights and as a past SnS organiser with very high standards for the event, I can reassure you that this year’s Smoky not Smudgy will be the best ever. I’ve been refraining from shopping in the past month because I know I’ll find lots of great one-off items from the SnS souk, as I always do! The fashion show is always the most exciting and buzzing part of the day. This year, the rumour is there are two fashion shows. The excitement is almost too much for me! I couldn’t imagine missing SnS, it’s not even an option!”
 So girls, make sure you don’t miss out!
