Although Nintendo let their big bosses have the honour of announcing the Nintendo 3DS, the successor to their current range of handheld consoles, the task apparently fell to Jonathan Ross to host the latest press conference on the upcoming device.

With disgusting beard and sharp quips in evidence, Ross took the stage on Wednesday along with Nintendo marketing exec and Clooney-lookalike [Laurent Fischer](http://www.google.co.uk/images?q=Laurent+Fischer) and even Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot. Together they revealed a wealth of information about the new console and also announced a March 25th launch date, no doubt chosen to coincide with the end of term at Imperial.

Along with the no-glasses-required 3D screens, it was revealed that the 3DS will also feature a motion sensor and a new circular directional pad. Proving again that you can make products better by simply sticking more stuff inside, Nintendo have added yet another camera to the record set by the DSi for a grand total of three cameras, one on the inside and two on the outside of the lid. Using these two cameras it will be possible to take 3D photos, saving them onto the 2GB SD card that comes with the system. It was also revealed a depth slider can be used to adjust the 3D effect.

Shortly after Wossy made another Sachsgate-esque comment about Laurent Fischer’s wife (we think), ‘SpotPass’ and ‘StreetPass’ were named as the two new ways to take advantage of the DS wireless functionality. SpotPass is Nintendo’s always-on Internet connection: whether playing games or in sleep mode (with the lid closed), the 3DS will connect automatically to compatible access points and download content in the background. [Eurosport](http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/) and [Aardman](http://www.aardman.com/) were named as partners who will be delivering exclusive 3D content via SpotPass.

StreetPass instead uses a local Wi-Fi connection to exchange details with nearby 3DS owners, and is again active even when in sleep mode. This allows users ‘in the street’ to exchange Miis and exclusive game content automatically just by walking past each other. DS owners will also be pleased to know that the disgustingly complicated friend code system has been simplified to give one code per system instead of one per game.

Nintendo also showed off some cool augmented reality features, a new Mii Maker studio capable of making Miis automatically from pictures taken with the cameras, and ‘Face Raiders’ – a shooting gallery made up of the faces you’ve taken. So, you can take your own picture, insert it into the gallery and shoot yourself in the face. Brilliant!

Also announced were the games: Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater, Pro Evolution Soccer 3D, Dead or Alive Dimensions, a new Resident Evil title and even remakes of The Legend of Zela: Ocarina of Time and Starfox 64.
