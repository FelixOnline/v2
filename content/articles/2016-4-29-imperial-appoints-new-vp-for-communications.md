Many of us suspect that Imperial’s concerned more with its image than ever before, and now it has hired a ‘Vice President for Communications and public affairs’. From September the new post will join the highest managers at Imperial, including the VPs for Advancement and Innovation.

There is no doubt that successful PR is needed to secure valuable funding for research, improving the university buildings and equipment, as well as providing for student bursary funds.

Alice Gast, Imperial’s President, said it was necessary to “forge connections across disciplines, institutions and borders” and to do this we need “excellent and thoughtful communications”. Upon his appointment, Blair said that Imperial had a “simply amazing brand”.

Imperial’s name and branding changed in 2010 from a more traditional crest to the current blue ‘Imperial College London’ logo.

Before crossing over to PR, Blair was a political correspondent at the Evening Standard. Now, at the top of his field, he is part of the London Communications Agency and has commanded over communications for parts of the NHS, TfL and the cabinet.

His LinkedIn profile also reports that he has a Grade 6 in trumpet.
