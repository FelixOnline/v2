Last Tuesday Imperial College Finance Society (ICFS) successfully overtook Medical Education (the biggest departmental society) in terms of membership. By Friday, ICFS reached yet another milestone by becoming the first society to exceed 2000 members.

What is it that has brought more students together than any department at Imperial? As a career-orientated society, the main focus of ICFS is organising events for its sponsors. Networking sessions and trading games had attendance at an all-time high, with several boasting more than 200 attendees. Some students even received invitations for an interview the following day and secured their dream job as a result. In particular, ICFS caused a riot outside Eastside bar when hundreds of suit-wearing members queued for a chance to rub shoulders with City professionals (and free pizza!).

It’s not all to do with finance, though! ICFS also held its first ever social event – those that gave it a chance had one of the best nights of their life, with food and drinks on us all night. Our annual dinner promises to be even better with more than £70 subsidy per person.

We also heavily subsidise our two international trips: the New York trip with all expenses paid for 22 members (including one lucky winner of a completely free trip!) and the Tanzania microfinance trip, which gives members an opportunity to volunteer their skills to help grow small sustainable businesses in close-knit communities. We also teamed up with RAG to promote corporate social responsibility by delivering the Charity Challenge of 2016, where Raincatcher Imperial won £1500 for their outstanding charitable efforts.

Following on from the success of our New Financial Worlds conference at Bloomberg HQ, we’re also hosting the London FinTech Conference 2016 in collaboration with other universities. CEOs and leaders of ground-breaking startups will discuss the future of the industry, with an opportunity to network and potential job leads.

We also hosted the University Investment Banking series, where both categories were won by Imperial teams, beating the likes of Cambridge and LSE.

The team behind a record-breaking year is the ICFS committee, who have dedicated a lot of their free time to using the resources they had available to the best of their ability.

The result is clear: our members have gained insight into the industry, made good contacts and had fun while doing it. With election time looming, people are extremely determined to be on next year’s ICFS team- it has accounted for around 200 new members. Will you be part of our story?
