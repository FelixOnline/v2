Jealous of your friends going backpacking this summer? Don’t be. London in the summer is wonderful and the weather rivals that on any expensive holiday abroad. One of the best things about spending summer here has to be [South West Four](http://www.southwestfour.com/). What better way to celebrate the end of your exams than two days dancing till the sun goes down (or comes up) to the world’s best house and techno DJs? It’s on your doorstep in Clapham Common so there’s no need to travel to a muddy field in the middle of nowhere, or pay the ludicrous prices of going to Ibiza.

Headlining on Saturday are electronic innovators Underworld playing their only show in London this year. John Digweed will be there coming home after performing at Exit, Sonar, and Ultra joined by fellow house heavyweights, Layo and Bushwacka and the not so youthful but always incredible Sven Väth of Cocoon records. Joining Sven are fellow Cocoon artists Loco Dice, brought up on hip hop and house, his grooves never fail to please, and Tiefschwarz with a live set, a line up destined to set the festival alight. Expect the best of classic trance and techno with the likes of James Zabiela tearing up the decks. The turntablist genius, with his triple deck, scratch effects anything goes master class will be a highlight of the Saturday. If more contemporary electro house is your cup of tea, Laidback Luke is also headlining. Joining these guys are techno veterans Laurent Garnier and Josh Wink, as well as big names in house music such as Germany’s M.A.N.D.Y.

If you prefer your grooves harder and your beats dirtier then Sunday is the day for you. Headlining the main stage are the infamous Pendulum and dubstep heavyweights, Benga, Skream and Artwork performing under their Magnetic Man alias. Joining the dubstep drum and bass vibe are jungle pioneers Shy Fx and Andy C along with Sub Focus.

The techno and house vibe carries on from the Saturday going darker into the grooves of Richie Hawtin, the founder of m-nus records whose innovative digital mixing will blow you away. This along with Adam Beyer, Paul Ritch and Ellen Allien provides one of the hottest line-ups of all festivals this summer. For the electro fans there is Eric Prydz playing his debut set under his Cirez D pseudonym and Simian Mobile Disco who remain the must see group of the moment.
