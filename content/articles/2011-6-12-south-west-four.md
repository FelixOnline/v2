Jealous of your friends going backpacking this summer? Don’t be. London in the summer is wonderful and the weather rivals that on any expensive holiday abroad. One of the best things about spending summer here has to be [South West Four](http://www.southwestfour.com/). What better way to celebrate the end of your exams than two days dancing till the sun goes down (or comes up) to the world’s best house and techno DJs? It’s on your doorstep in Clapham Common so there’s no need to travel to a muddy field in the middle of nowhere, or pay the ludicrous prices of going to Ibiza.

Headlining on Saturday are electronic innovators __Underworld__ playing their only show in London this year. __John Digweed__ will be there coming home after performing at Exit, Sonar, and Ultra joined by fellow house heavyweights, __Layo__ and __Bushwacka__ and the not so youthful but always incredible __Sven Väth__ of Cocoon records. Joining Sven are fellow Cocoon artists __Loco Dice__, brought up on hip hop and house, his grooves never fail to please, and __Tiefschwarz__ with a live set, a line up destined to set the festival alight. Expect the best of classic trance and techno with the likes of __James Zabiela__ tearing up the decks. The turntablist genius, with his triple deck, scratch effects anything goes master class will be a highlight of the Saturday. If more contemporary electro house is your cup of tea, __Laidback Luke__ is also headlining. Joining these guys are techno veterans __Laurent Garnier__ and __Josh Wink__, as well as big names in house music such as Germany’s __M.A.N.D.Y.__

If you prefer your grooves harder and your beats dirtier then Sunday is the day for you. Headlining the main stage are the infamous __Pendulum__ and dubstep heavyweights, __Benga__, __Skream__ and __Artwork__ performing under their __Magnetic Man__ alias. Joining the dubstep drum and bass vibe are jungle pioneers __Shy Fx__ and __Andy C__ along with __Sub Focus__.

The techno and house vibe carries on from the Saturday going darker into the grooves of __Richie Hawtin__, the founder of m-nus records whose innovative digital mixing will blow you away. This along with __Adam Beyer__, __Paul Ritch__ and __Ellen Allien__ provides one of the hottest line-ups of all festivals this summer. For the electro fans there is __Eric Prydz__ playing his debut set under his __Cirez D__ pseudonym and __Simian Mobile Disco__ who remain the must see group of the moment.
