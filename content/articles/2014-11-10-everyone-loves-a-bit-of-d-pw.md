__B: Where are you from, and how has it affected your outlook on Imperial?__

C: I’m from Bristol. I suppose Bristol isn’t that diverse, so coming to London, specifically Imperial, has been a very enjoyable experience for me, meeting lots of different people from lots of different countries. It’s been great.

__B: What do you plan to do after your sabbatical year?__

C: That’s a very good question. Honestly, I don’t know. I’ve give it quite a lot of thought to, but I didn’t have time to do a lot of job applications in the final year of my degree last year, and then when I ran for elections and won, I was quite relieved.

Even if I did have a job lined up, I would have taken the sabb year instead, because I’ve always wanted to contribute to the union and I’m happy to have this job for a year. I’m not sure about afterwards, I’m thinking maybe patent law or just teaching.

__B: Did you always plan to run for a sabbatical position?__

C: Erm. Yes, I think so. I’ve always been rather cynical about the Union. And I thought ‘why not put my money where my mouth is?”

__B: Why Welfare?__

C: Support for students is something I’ve always cared very deeply about. I think it’s an area the College is not doing enough in, it’s something I ought to improve. A lot of people have a tough time at Imperial and I don’t think the support is there.

__B: Have you been personally affected?__

C: It’s not something I want to go into. But, yes, I’ve had issues while I’ve been here. And I know others who have too, and it’s not just people who are here and struggling, some people have left and didn’t finish their degrees after they couldn’t cope because the support wasn’t there. I think it’s very sad.

__B: So why did you say you think the role of DP Education and Welfare could be combined?__

C: I’ve always thought the Union has been rather bloated. Because Imperial is primarily an academic institution, I’ve always found it hard to arbitrarily separate the roles of education and student welfare. But, to ‘abolish the role’ was never a part of my manifesto! It’s something I suspect I may change my views on as the year progresses. At this moment in time, I’m still cynical about the need for five full-time officer trustees as well as Felix editor and Medic President.

__B: Do you interact with Pascal, Deputy President (Education) a lot? Do you still not feel like there are two separate jobs which need full-time employees?__

C: I’m still not convinced. But term hasn’t properly started yet, so maybe when 3000 new people arrive, my views may change?

__B: Does that mean that you haven't been busy?__

C: I’ve had times where I’ve been busy and some days where I’ve not been. Some days at the start of August, I’ve had nothing to do but twiddle my thumbs. Work has started to pick up now, which I’m quite relieved about.

__B: Is this the reason why you've decided to give away a third of your wage?__

C: Well, no. My justification for doing that is because I think the role is overpaid. I think there are people who will quite happily do the role for significantly less than the current salary. Especially if you take into consideration that we get free accommodation. Even with me giving a third of my salary away, it’s more than sufficient to live in London.

__B: How do you think the other sabbs feel about you giving up a third of your salary?__

C: I think they’re probably surprised I’m doing what I said I would do.

__B: Is your donation to Imperial because you feel passionate about supporting Imperial in general? For example, would you donate a significant amount of your future salary to Imperial after you leave?__

C: That’s a good question. It depends on how Imperial develops. I’m currently here for a year and I can actually see where the money goes, so it makes me keener to donate. I originally said I would donate to the Scholarship fund, but I decided to donate to the Hardship fund, because not everyone who gets a scholarship needs the money.

__B: You've said you haven't had much work to do so far, but can you give a day to day account?__

C: Each day is different. I’ve done some subwarden interviews in the evenings, but that’s ended now. This week I was looking through NSS freeform comment data, because the Union is doing a response to the NSS results. I’ve also been doing work on the response to the closure of the ‘post study work visa for international students’.

__B: Can you comment on the closure of the Evelyn Gardens halls? What would you do it anything like that happened again?__

C: My personal view is that College should make Evelyn Gardens halls available for students after the redevelopment, even if the rent is higher, because it is still a better situation than having to live in Acton – where students are still paying a high rent and have to pay travel costs.

__B: Why do you not think the Union was not listened to when the decision was being made about Acton halls?__

C: There was a confidentiality agreement. College had already made a decision and signed the contract before the ‘Against Acton’ campaign. The campaign was too little, too late. This is sad, but I honestly don’t think the Union could have done anything to have changed their mind.

__B: Is there anything you want to change this year which involves College participation?__

C: I think the counselling service needs drastic improvement. The wait is too long and it’s understaffed. I think it needs more funding. I’m working with College on the Wellbeing task group, but I think it won’t affect the students right here, who need help now.

__B: Do you think the average student would be able to properly judge how you have performed at your job?__

C: I’ve always been very wary of saying that voters aren’t informed enough to make decisions. I’ve always felt strongly that people are very intelligent and are capable of making informed decisions. At the end of the year, I could make a case of how I did, and I think students should be able to make a decision on that. I trust voters.

__B: Okay, let's have some fun questions. What is your biggest online timewaster? __

C: I don’t actually use those. I use Wikipedia, but I’m not a big editor of it… I read a lot of blogs and the news online. I generally try and do that during my lunch break than when I’m supposed to be working. I read various political blogs and politicalbetting.com, not that I’m not a big gambler, I just find it interesting.

__B: With the current sabbs, if you were trapped on a desert island with them, who would you collectively decide to eat first?__

C: Tom Wheeler would probably be the last survivor because he does a lot of outdoor stuff. I would probably be the first to go, but I don’t have very much meat, so I might not be a tactical first meal. That’s a very interesting question which I can’t answer in a diplomatic way.

__B: If you had to have tinder, what bio would you have?__

C: ‘IF I had to have tinder?!’ That’s a very hypothetical question! In my bio I would say that I was a Chemistry graduate, that I’m being paid in a job, and that I am 6 foot tall, even though I am only 5 foot 11.5. So yeah: 6 foot tall, salary, graduate.

__B: Hmm, very informative. And positive! Which Imperial establishment would you go for your first date in?__

C: Not the Union! Because the risk of me running into someone I know would be too high and too awkward and embarrassing. Probably Eastside bar, because it almost looks like it’s not on a university campus at all.

__B: If you were allowed to name a Union drinking place, like h-bar or Metric, what would you name it?__

C: I’d probably name it the Holland Club. I’d make sure it had some personality and charm. Unlike h-bar.

__B: Can you recommend any bars or nightclubs for the Freshers? Or any to avoid?__

C: Avoid at all costs Ministry of Sound. It’s a nightmare to get to, it’s a bigger nightmare to get back from, it’s overrated and they treat you like a terrorist when you walk in because of the metal detectors.

I’m not really a big clubber, I prefer bars where music is quiet enough to have a conversation.

Eastside bar has proper beer, unlike the Union… no don’t say that!
