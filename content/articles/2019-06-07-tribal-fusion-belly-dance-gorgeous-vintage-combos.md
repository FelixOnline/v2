As featured in previous editions of _Felix_ this term, the Belly Dancing Society is currently hosting a series of summer workshops in a variety of belly dance fusion styles. The last workshop of term is now approaching, where we’ll be exploring Tribal Fusion Belly Dance. Tribal Fusion is a western belly dance style originating in the ‘60s in San Francisco, USA, which fuses middle eastern belly dance with elements of flamenco, hip-hop, Kathak, Odissi, and a variety of folkloric dance styles from around the world. The combination of all these different dances makes for a very intricate and diverse dance style!

We’ve invited Catherine Taylor to give her workshop on “Gorgeous Vintage Combos” wherein we’ll learn combos utilising Burlesque, Belly Dance and Tribal Fusion movements to channel our inner pinup - get your sass on in this fun and feisty workshop! As with all of our previous workshops, we welcome people of all levels (even if you’ve never danced before) to try out our classes – they’re always lots of fun!

Catherine is a London-based performer and teacher of Tribal Fusion, ITS and - under the pseudonym Vul Varine - Burlesque. She is known for her strong stage presence and innovative choreographies, as well as her engaging and approachable teaching style. She is a founding member of the Tribal Fusion troupe Curious Verses, director of the ITS troupe Sigma, and is co-organiser of highly popular cabaret show The Honeysuckle Revue. She was also an original member of the London Algerian Ballet, and has trained in Polynesian dance, Silvestre Technique and Orixa dance movement.

Unfortunately that’s it now for the belly dance society’s classes this term. We’ll be starting up again with a full timetable of Beginners, Advanced and Tribal Fusion classes in the Autumn term, so keep your eye on our activities come October – you can contact us in a variety of ways detailed below. We hope you all have lovely summers!
