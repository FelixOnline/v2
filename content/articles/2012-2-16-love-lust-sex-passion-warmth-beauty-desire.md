__The 1930s: Queen Christina__

If you want to watch a love story where a monarch gives up a throne for love, don’t watch Madonna’s latest, W.E., which is a bland, dull retelling of this century’s greatest romance. Watch instead the divine, majestic Greta Garbo’s Queen Christina, in which she plays a Swedish queen, torn between her loyalty for her people and her love for a Spanish nobleman which is much criticised by her country. Garbo, the talented Swedish beauty who was the Queen of MGM (the film production company that “owned” her) in the 30s had a string of films that were released and proved to be instant hits. Her piercing gaze, large and clear eyes, and thick but comprehensible accent, make her the perfect heroine in a tragic love story. Closing with one of the most unfogettable close-ups of Garbo’s strikingly beautiful face, Queen Christina is an emotional, heart-breaking love story.

__The 1940s: Casablanca__

It was an easy one to decide, this. With endlessly quotable dialogue from its magnificently nostalgic script, along with a high-profile Hollywood pairing between two actors that has subsquently been copied but never defeated, this story of unfulfilled love, regret and sacrifice is simply irresistible. The sudden appearance of an old flame (Ingrid Bergman) is bad news for a local bar owner (Humphrey Bogart) living in Morocco, away from all the violence sweeping through Europe during the early years of the Second World War. They both have a chance to escape to America but his love seems to have turned up with a new man of her own. Ending with one of the bravest, most heart-wrenching scenes of all time without a hint of any over the top sugary sweetness, Casablanca is the one essential black and white film that must be watched even for those who aren’t so keen on old-fashioned style.

__The 1950s: An Affair to Remember__

Although not without its cheesy moments, and the misunderstanding that tears this couple apart is no doubt painfully frustrating to watch, the sizzling chemistry that Cary Grant shares with Deborah Kerr simply melts away any little missteps this may have made on the way. Despite its second half drifting more towards the tragic side of love, there is plenty of sassy, quick-witted banter between the two that allows sparks to fly. Add to that the sensational original song written by Harry Warren, Harold Adamson and Leo McCarey, and you get one of the most iconic love stories of all time. The Empire State Building became more popular due to the romantic setting of this film, and although rather poorly adapted by Nora Ephron in her Sleepless in Seattle, An Affair to Remember thankfully has its reputation intact.

__The 1960s: Bonnie and Clyde__

The strong word-of-mouth success of this was the prime reason Warren Beatty, the star and producer, walked away with a large sum of cash and Faye Dunaway was propelled into stardom in her debut role. In the tricky roles of a couple of bank-robbers and eventual killers, Beatty and Dunaway make one heck of a duo and their team, consisting of Gene Hackman, Estelle Parsons and, is one worth rooting for – which is why the tragic final scene, shot with such effective speed, accuracy and sudden close-ups, has more impact. Even through the toughest, potentially life-threatening situations, this brave couple copes by relying on and having faith in each other. They commit crimes, and Bonnie even goes so far as to cheerfully exclaim “we rob banks!” but their convincing passion and committment have a thing or two to teach us all.

__The 1970s: Love Story__

Love stories and tragic, tear-jerking dramas don’t come much thicker than this. The famous “love means never having to say you’re sorry” line was coined here, as two awfully pretty star-crossed lovers Ryan O’Neal and Ali MacGraw are separated and put through hardship by their differences in wealth, class and eventually poor health. This may have more manipulative emotional pit falls than any other film you may experience in the future, but it remains a firm favourite amongst the most romance-loving audience members. Based on a phenomenally popular book, the film turned out to be a massive hit too, raking in over a hundred million dollars back in the 70s States alone, on a modest budget of $2.2m. The Oscar winning score also plays a huge part in creating a sombre, rich, melancholy atmosphere, another something to break your heart in the film’s most tender moments.

__The 1980s: On Golden Pond__

Not all love stories need to be about young, immature, attractive couples discovering the ups and downs of committment with many tragic events along the way. What is more deeply touching is the bond shared for decades, which is what is shown On Golden Pond between Norman (Henry Fonda) and Ethel (Katharine Hepburn.) The film is as much about their long-lasting love as well as the uneasy relationship shared by Norman and his daughter, played by Jane Fonda (no prizes for guessing how she’s related to Henry Fonda). It’s a calm and collected film of many similarly styled performances, with a careful, close perception of a typical family life. An absolute must for anyone looking to be blown away by the superb portrayal of everlasting affection and dedication, and even for the coldest cynics who always struggle to sit through a number of corny romantic films.

Other worthy nominees: Out of Africa, Moonstruck, When Harry Met Sally, Reds

__The 1990s: Ghost__

The late Patrick Swayze was always asked by fans to utter the word “ditto” to them and if you’re unsure as to why that is, watch Ghost and find out that sometimes, the words “I love you” are often overrated. Even in death, Sam’s (Swayze) soul lingers on Earth in order to complete his one final task: keep his girlfriend Molly (Demi Moore) safe from those who had him killed. Molly struggles to move on of course (especially after that pottery scene, no-one would) but not everything is a complete downer. With a killer comic relief performance from Whoopi Goldberg as the sole person who can communicate with the dead soul of Sam, it achieves a nice balance between tragic romance and hysterical comedy, never undermining or sacrificing one another. Another well-played chart-topper came from this – The Righteous Brothers’ “Unchained Melody.”

__The 2000s: Atonement__

War drives a lot of unfortunate lovers apart, and nothing is more heart-breaking to see than two people who could have and should have been able to spend more time together. Due to a little girl’s misguided imagination, Robbie (James McAvoy) is separated from his true love Cecilia (Keira Knightley); first being escorted to prison, then to the front line of the First World War. Will they ever reunite? It’s unclear throughout the course of the film but what is apparent is the two lovers’ painful longing for the years and years they remain apart. The final moments of the film, handled so well in their sheer modesty and sincerity with acting veteran Vanessa Redgrave shining in her brief scene, are devastating yet incredibly satisfying. Although it covers a long duration, it is a neatly condensed, highly watchable affair, immaculately presented by a truly talented English director, Joe Wright.

Other worthy nominees: Away From Her, Once, Brokeback Mountain, The Notebook, Amelie
