Summer is on its way and festival season is nearly upon us. Do you long to frolic in the sunshine with live music, alcohol and food… but don’t want to spend a fortune? Have your heard of Silfest?
 Silfest is a music festival held yearly on the grounds of the Silwood Park campus of Imperial College London. Silfest will entertain you with all day live music, lots of entertainments, food and DJs playing late into the night. Will your summer be complete without creating your own ice-cream with liquid nitrogen? Fancy yourself a circus performer? Do you dream of a wide selection of alcohol at student prices? Perhaps you just want to escape London to a land of greenery and rabbits? Silfest is the place to be.

Silwood Park is the ideal location for a music festival, boasting around 100 ha of land including fields to camp in, woodland, streams and a large Victorian manor house where the DJs will be playing. And of course only a mere 50 minute train journey form Waterloo station.

Come and enjoy the sun at Silfest 2013 on the 27th of July. Listen to live music, explore the woods, drink, eat, dance and drink some more, before crashing into your tent and camping under the stars with the rabbits and deer.
