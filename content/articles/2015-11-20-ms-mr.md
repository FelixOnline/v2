It’s rare to find a band with such mesmerising on-stage chemistry. Last Tuesday at Electric Brixton, MS MR brought their dynamic live show to London.

Lead singer Lizzy Plapinger’s genuine excitement was evident in her sweat and tears; her presence put the audience in a state of awe. It was difficult not to gaze at her as she sparkled across the stage in her glittery playsuit.

With performances that are as energetic as this, it’s forgiveable that the vocals are drowned out and breathy. The catchy synths and bombastic drums were a little more pleasing than Plapinger’s middling vocals. But when compared to the recorded versions, many of the songs felt messy.

Only the best can balance a bold stage presence with an excellent live sound. Unfortunately, MS MR aren’t quite there yet.
