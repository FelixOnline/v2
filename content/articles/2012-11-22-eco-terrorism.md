Classed as the number one domestic threat in the US since 2001, eco-terrorism is estimated to have cost $300million between 2003 and 2008. Organisations like EarthFirst!, the Earth Liberation Front (ELF), the Animal Liberation Front, GreenPeace and PETA have been accused of radical environmentalism and actions. Tree spiking, arson and even bombing are methods used by environmentalist groups to express their point. Radical environmentalists are often associated to anti-capitalism and a general belief that capitalism and the patriarchal society are responsible for damaging and destroying nature.

One of the most well known radical eco-groups is ELF. Founded in 1992 in Brighton, the movement rapidly spread to therest of the world. ELF have run an “eco-guerrilla” in America, destroying US Forest Industries’ headquarters and setting fire to ski resorts and houses. The movement was the centre of Operation Backfire, started in 2004 by the FBI to stop extreme environmentalist action. ELF hasn’t claimed attacks since 2006.

Eco-terrorism is also perceived as a threat in the UK. Environmental activists are often under surveillance, even though no real plan has been uncovered to date.
