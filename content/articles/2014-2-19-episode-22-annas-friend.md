If you want to read about the start of Anna's tale, here is the link: [Episode 2.1 Anna's Grace](../games/4371/dayz-episode-21-annas-grace/)[
](../games/4336/episode-2-annas-hunger/)

After having met that strange man I decided to stay low for next few hours. However before I could even say “stay low” I heard yet another voice shouting something.

“Hey man, I’m heading over to cherno. I don’t have any food or anything can you help me out?” a very Scottish accent said.

From my obviously useless cover I eyed this guy up. He sounded sane enough, and didn’t look that crazy either. Maybe my I had finally found a friend! Wearily I stepped out.

“Sure I have some food, what do you have to offer me for it?”

“Well, I can always offer you your life.”

He said it so incredibly calmly and eerily that it sent chills down my spine. Before he could react, I ran at him and hit him in the head with my axe. He immediately dropped. I whacked him in the head again, just to make sure he was really dead. I had now killed someone. I turned and left, not even looting the mangled corpse that lay bleeding behind me. However on second I decided I would hide and see if anything interesting happened. I found myself a better bush than last time, and waited it out. Twenty minutes later, another man ran towards the body. He looked at the corpse, then turned to the sky.

“I will find you, you bitch!!!”, he screamed.

Very worried he had seen me I crouched down low. Soon however it became apparent that he had just vented his anger. As I saw him looking for me from my hiding spot, I smiled and thought: Can’t wait till you do.
