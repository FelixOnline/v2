     Very interesting, any updates? The same issue was explored over 5 years ago by the Union: <br> <br>https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/your-union/how-were-run/committees/07-08/Representation_%26_Welfare_Board/file/1050 <br> <br>https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/your-union/how-were-run/committees/07-08/Representation_%26_Welfare_Board/file/1051 <br> <br>Very sad reading the challenges faced by final year students. The sheer volume of work involved in writing up (in most cases the 4th year is spent doing further experiments and THEN analyses before the 'writing' actually begins) combined with no income makes for a very stressful time, and surely decreases the quality of the PhD thesis. <br> <br>Wonder why College have changed their tune since then? Maybe due to the negative impression it gives international students (a major source of income for departments). <br> <br>Supervisors have to take some of the blame too - they'll advertise a 3-year PhD, the demand that publications are written during the 3 years. This extends the PhD wel

It is likely that PhD students will be getting their writeup period extended to twelve months for all Departments, it emerged on Tuesday 12 February.

[Imperial College Union Council passed a pape](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/your-union/how-were-run/committees/12-13/Union_Council/file/1832)r that resolved to discuss the idea with key stakeholders and to lobby College. It was mentioned in Council that College are already for the idea, and so it seems unlikely to not work.

Currently, not all students get twelve months to write up their PhD after they complete their experiments. Some get six months, after which they lose access to College and the journal subscriptions. This is annoying for students and is why it is possibly changing.
