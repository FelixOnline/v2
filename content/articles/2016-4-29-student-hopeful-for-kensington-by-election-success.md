Next week, local elections are happening up and down the country, most notably the London Mayoral elections, but slightly closer to home is the Kensington and Chelsea Councillor by-election in which Imperial College physics student Ben Fernando is standing.

University Challenge star, Fernando, is running as a Labour Party candidate for the upcoming Abingdon ward by-election after the previous two councillors stepped down earlier this year. Both of the previous councillors were Conservative with one being the new Kensington MP and former deputy London Mayor, Lady Borwick.

The ward, which encompasses most of the area between Cromwell Road and Kensington High Street (essentially west of the Cromwell Road Sainsbury’s), has historically been a strong Conservative majority and Ben, last year’s RAG Chair and former Imperial Labour Society President, faces an uphill struggle if he wants to reverse this.
> > **He hopes to tackle social issues in the borough should he be elected**
Speaking to FELIX, Fernando explained that he hopes to tackle social issues in the borough should he be elected, namely social housing, pushing the introduction of the new Crossrail station on the King’s Road and the redevelopment of local schools. Fernando also felt he could be the fresh face needed to bring about this change, as well as being a voice for the young people of the area.

Having received a letter notifying him of the vacant position, Ben threw his hat into the ring but stressed that this was not the start of a political career and that he will still be undertaking his PhD next year regardless of the outcome.

If elected, Ben would follow in the footsteps of former Imperial political alumni, almost a dozen of whom have gone on to become British MPs, as well as Rajiv Gandhi and Julius Vogel, the former Prime Ministers of India and New Zealand respectively. Speaking on his chances Fernando said: “It’s unlikely but you never know”.

If you do happen to live in the Abingdon ward, and are registered to vote in the upcoming elections, keep a look out for him campaigning over the coming week as you will get to decide Ben’s fate on May 5th.
