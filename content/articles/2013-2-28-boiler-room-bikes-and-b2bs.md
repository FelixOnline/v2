When I first considered writing an article on Boiler Room, I thought it would be redundant. I always thought that it’s just one of those things that everyone who would be interested knows about, but when I started chatting to people about it I realised this is not really the case. Considering how electronic Imperial’s tastes seem to be, as well as our churning out a pretty incredible number of DJs and producers, I felt this needed remedying.

So, the basics: Boiler Room is essentially a promoter who gets incredible line-ups of electronic musicians, shoves them in a tiny room with a number of the city’s biggest hipsters and broadcasts a TV stream live over the internet. That said, they’re not always electronic people; just last Friday they threw an incredible event with __BEAK>__ (live), __Anika__ (DJ set) and __Jaakko__ (live) and on Wednesday had the whole__ Boy Better Know__ crew live in the place.

The whole thing is sponsored by the great folks over at Red Stripe – yet another perk, free beer – and for a good few events now they’ve paired up officially with Boiler Room to present Red Stripe Make Sessions. I was first introduced to this concept at the NTS one back in November, where 11 painfully obscure artists were crammed into a 4 hour slot and their sets recorded live onto reel-to-reel tape. The product of the evening was a sweet compilation vinyl; particular highlights include the incredibly bass-heavy __Insomniax__’s ‘Speakers Blow’ and __Graham Dunning__’s loop-manipulating experimentalism.

The real spark for this piece was Red Stripe Make Session 007 on Monday, which Red Stripe kindly let us tag along to. The musical line-up was simple but heavy: __xxxy__ b2b __Steve Braiden__ and __Midland__ b2b __Paul Woolford__. In a slightly surreal centre stage, 14 Bike Co were brought into the building to hand make some damn fine bespoke bikes with the DJs names painted onto the frames.

It must be said that as much as I love it, Boiler Room does have a bit of a reputation (especially in London) for not getting crazy at all – have a look through the Facebook comments on almost any of their photos and you’ll see what I mean. I was hoping that having purely b2b sets would bring the energy up, and I’m not sure whether it was that or the sheer size of the venue relative to normal but it certainly got pretty mental. The end of __Midland__ and __Woolford__’s set in particular was not only one of the most impressive pieces of track selection I’ve seen but also sent the crowd absolutely wild. Definitely watch it if Boiler Room archive it, and watch out for IC Radio’s head of programming with his hipster glasses at the front.
