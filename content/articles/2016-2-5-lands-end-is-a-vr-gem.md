For a gaming device to truly succeed it needs a great launch title. Land’s End, a virtual reality puzzle adventure from the creators of Monument Valley, is the game that every owner of the device must play. Developers Ustwo truly understand the power of the new medium and where it works best, and they’ve used that knowledge to create something that feels completely new.

Set over five short chapters and distinct environments, players must help awaken an ancient civilisation. Those who have played Thatgamecompany’s (yes, that’s actually their name) Journey will notice the obvious visual and thematic similarities. The game’s title has many obvious meanings, but one of it’s most literal is the way it frequently places you at the edge of a cliff, allowing you to peer down into the sea (or abyss) below.

To move around the environment, the game uses head tracking. You look at a place on the screen and the camera moves. Ustwo have got right what many other developers have got wrong – physical controllers really break the immersion of virtual reality, so why not do away with them? The device’s head tracking ability also gives you the ability to look at objects and move them with your mind; you’ll have to do this often to help you solve environmental, and more traditional, puzzles. For an hour or so I really felt like I had the power of telekinesis.

The game also plays with perspective as part of the puzzle solving gameplay. Unfortunately, this isn’t used enough which feels like an oversight for a game that makes the most of VR.

Land’s End might look simple in comparison to VR titles on Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive (which is mainly a technical limitation), but it’s stylised, cell-shaded graphics are one of its best features. Dreamy colour palettes and spectacular lighting illuminate environments ranging from small cave interiors to massive collections of islands.

Sometimes you’ll come at these environments from above, slowly descending into the depths below. At other times, you leave a cave only to be blinded by sunlight. The most breathtaking moments are when you soar above the landscape (and this happens a lot); you get a real sense of scale which can only be achieved with stereoscopic virtual reality. Unfortunately, this often leads to motion sickness, although I haven’t thrown up yet.

Land’s End, although short, leaves a mighty impression. It’s the first truly great mobile VR experience.
