Last week, Felix reported that students had found their way onto the roof of Beit using the sheer mental power provided to the excellent students of this institution. Stephwen Hughes, Head of Health, Safety & Fire at Imperial College London, followed up with the following statement:

â€œStudents have placed themselves at considerable risk by deliberately breaching the measures put in place by the College to prevent unauthorised persons accessing hazardous areas. The measures including window restrictors and controlled access doors are there for the safety and wellbeing of staff and students who will not be aware of the risk presented by the roof and balconies.

I would take this opportunity to remind students that they have a duty, under health and safety law and College policy, to co-operate fully with all measures put in place by the College to safeguard their safety and wellbeing. They are also responsible for their own safety and that of others who could be affected by their acts or omissions."

The College will now put additional measures in place to avoid a repeat of such an incident.
