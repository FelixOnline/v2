The Blyth Centre has announced the opening of a new facility catering for student and staff artists. A large room in Weeks Hall has been refurbished to function as an art studio. Access to the space and materials will be made available to members of the studio. This can be purchased for £10 for members of Leonardo Fine Arts Society and £20 for everyone else. Both LeoSoc and the Blyth Gallery have plans to hold workshops and lessons in the new facility. The move reflects an expansion of the Blyth Centre’s traditional focus on Music towards the visual arts.
