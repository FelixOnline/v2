Three academics at Imperial College have received some of the highest awards in the country for their work in the sciences in the New Year’s Honours, announced on December 31. These honours are issued by the Monarch on the advice of the Government for exemplary service.

[Professor Sir Stephen Bloom](http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/people/s.bloom/), the head of the Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism division in the Department of Medicine; and [Professor Sir Simon Donaldson](http://www2.imperial.ac.uk/~skdona/), a researcher into geometry and topology at the department of Mathematics, have both been appointed Knight Bachelors. In addition, [Professor David Philips](http://www.rsc.org/AboutUs/Governance/RSCCouncil/CouncilMembersBiography/DPhillipsBio.asp), a researcher at the Department of Chemistry, as well as President of the Royal Society of Chemistry, has been made a Commander of the British Empire (CBE).

As well as the members of staff, five members of Imperial’s alumni have been given honours, including a Knighthood and a Damehood (the female equivalent).

The Rector of Imperial College has extended his congratulations to the staff and alumni. In a statement to Imperial’s Press Office, he said: “These researchers, along with the Imperial alumni who have been honoured, represent some of the very best that the UK has to give. On behalf of the College, I offer them all my warmest congratulations."
