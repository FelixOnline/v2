The summer months were spent catching up with friends back home, travelling, earning money to blow on rent and, for some, geological mapping. Mixed in with this, the Royal School of Mines committee had carefully planned their start of term activities leading up to the big one: Freshers' Dinner.

On 17th October, 178 people attended the Annual Dinner at The Rembrandt Hotel, 91 of them freshers from the Materials and Earth Science departments; this reflects the high demand for the social events that the RSM provides for its members.

All the first years, accompanied by their older undergraduate hosts, marched along Exhibition Road looking rather dapper and not too out of place out and about in South Kensington. Upon arrival at The Rembrandt they were greeted by an array of black and gold decorations, and empty helium tanks that definitely weren’t inhaled by Vice-President James Cox. President Ben Warnick started proceedings with an impressive welcoming speech, including a hysterical poem read from the “RSM Bible”.

The three course meal went down a treat with everyone, a different league from those student budget meals your uni friends cook and upload pictures of onto Facebook in the hope of a few “likes”. No, this was a formal three course dinner from a five star hotel in Kensington, food we at the RSM like to savour for our big events: chicken liver pâté with compote, cod fillet with creamy chive sauce, ratatouille and potato rosti cake to name a few.

Also in attendance were two guest speakers: Dr Martyn McLachlan from Materials and Dr Matt Genge from the Earth Science department. Both are popular lecturers among students in their respective departments, and quickly became the centre of attention with eye-catching and funny speeches to the audience.

One highlight of the evening included third year geologist Matt Irwin, who took centre stage, declaring that his table would like to raise a toast to the President and his committee for organising the event. Then all five hosts and five freshers at the table stood up, and literally “raised a toast” by holding aloft slices of toast to the committee table. Their pockets may have been filled with burnt crumbs, but the gag was successfully pulled off. Well played, boys.

After the closing speeches – as is standard – the Scottish contingent of RSM spontaneously burst into song as “Flower Of Scotland” rang through the room. This was not planned, and was not prompted for any reason, but it did not stop Dr McLachlan joining in and taking lead. The RSM, still looking stylish in their formal wear, proceeded to head back through South Kensington for a post-dinner gathering at the Union, which included discussions along the lines of “what a jolly good dinner that was”.

It was the first time that the Fresher’s Dinner had been held at The Rembrandt; rave reviews came from those who attended and even hotel staff.

A big shout out goes to Vice-President Tor Tennant and Ball Officers Abbie Trice and Bethan Clark for organising the event.
