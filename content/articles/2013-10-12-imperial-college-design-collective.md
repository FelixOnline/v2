As I walk below the Queen’s Tower, before an evening in Central Library, I look up at the surrounding buildings (you guessed it… I’m a civil engineering undergrad!) and the environmental conscience inside me is thinking: “What are all these rooms doing lit-up? We should be turning the lights out as soon as students leave their lectures and tutorials...” Little did I know that within these rooms, there are students. Some of them are studying, but others are doing something even better! They’ve just decided to create a new society at Imperial!  
 During the Summer Term of 2012, several Mechanical Engineering students decided to start the Imperial College Design Collective. Design was something that was touched upon in some of their classes, and actually in most engineering degrees. However, students often have to give it a second priority compared to the wave of workload of Mathematics, Mechanics, Dynamics… well a lot of ‘ics’ essentially. They saw beyond this wave and realised that their engineering skills were valued in the design world. Product design needs people with hard knowledge to manufacture and prototype the idea. And in the wide range of design, there is always a place for the ideas of pragmatic and educated scientists, medics, and engineers.  
 You’ll ask me: “Why did they call it the Design Collective?” That’s quite simple actually. These entrepreneurial students decided that although this design society was born out of the Mechanical Engineering building, they knew they wanted to involve as many students as possible from all possible degrees and backgrounds. They wanted a collective of students that could bring a variety of background knowledge and skills in order to inspire each other in the design process!  
 The Imperial College Design Collective (ICDC) had an amazing first year following its genesis. Coming from all over Imperial College of Science, Medicine and Technology, and even the Imperial Business School, 56 members were inspired by the themes of Enhancing Cycling in London, Sustainability, Toys, and Interactive City. Even more attended the talks by architect Andrew Waugh, brand designer Simon Manchipp, engineering designer Peter Childs, and urban designer Kathryn Firth. With two office visits to IDEO in Clerkenwell and Pentagram in Notting Hill, members were immersed into a universe of brilliance in creating processes, objects, projects that enhance the human experience.  
 This year, the committee has prepared new themes for the collective to build upon. Some members may come to an interesting talk by a guest, others will favour the Wednesday afternoon workshops, and some will be privileged with a visit to a London design office.  
 I first came to Andrew Waugh’s presentation of his battle to build the first multi-storey residential timber building in London, and I recognized my need for alternate activities to my degree and sports. I loved attending the evening talks and being inspired by the passion of entrepreneurs who used their educational and professional background to create something that they thought could benefit society. And that’s really why I encourage everyone to join this energy-fuelled society that will add a spice of creativity and a dash of entrepreneurship to your Imperial experience.
