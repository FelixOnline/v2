__Big Miracle__

__Director__ Ken Kwapis
__Screenwriters__ Jack Amiel, Michael Begler, Thomas Rose (novel)
__Cast__ Drew Barrymore, John Krasinski

Whales... gotta love them; and this is exactly the kind of emotional response Big Miracle is counting on. Even for those who couldn’t care less about animals or the environment, Kwapis’ pleasant enough family picture where we see a group of brave scientists, environmental activists, reporters, native Alaskans, and Russians (??), trying to rescue three trapped California Grey Whales will have enough emotional impact to tug at the heart strings.

Inspired by true events of 1988, we start off almost straightaway seeing the poor three whales trapped under the thick ice of Alaska with only a small opening providing room for breathing. Their only way to escape is five miles away, the kind of distance they cannot swim for without coming out of the water to breathe; and because of Alaska’s harsh climate, the only air-hole that is keeping them alive is starting to close up.

Their struggle for survival is unintentionally discovered by Adam Carlson (Krasinski), a news anchor dispatched to Alaska who is looking to make a name for himself despite being in a place that hardly generates any substantial news for the rest of the world to see. What starts off as a local sensation turns into a national news topic, where even people in sunny California are captivated by the news. Reporters from all around the States, and later the world, flock to Alaska in the hopes of getting a glimpse of the whales. Adam is particularly glad to see Jill Jerard (Kristen Bell), a talented, ambitious young anchor he has fancied for a long time.

A rescue mission is put together to free these whales – a process that does not come about easily. But it’s thanks to Greenpeace worker Rachel Kramer (Barrymore) who relentlessly goes after Mayors and Congressmen, that after a while, her efforts pay off and even The White House gets involved in the effort. It’s not initially easy trying to get high political staff interested in a few whales struggling to survive, but Barrymore speaks with humour, heart and conviction. Her endless passion on this subject matter may be hard to comprehend at first, or even particularly like, but the actress’ consistent effort mirrors that of her character, and at some point, she does win people over. Her performance feels genuine, and it’s with her kind of likability that Big Miracle soars past the usual sugary sweet animal drama.

Clearly aimed for families, and therefore children, Big Miracle does not hover over the serious aspects of its plot for long. With every difficulty comes an immediate, back-up, almost too convenient answer, without ever exploring to much depth the more realistic, pessimistic side of events. At times it becomes too simplistic and refuses to look at the big picture. What about the massive financial cost this must have had? Surely not everyone was up for spending tax dollars rescuing some animals? Perhaps I’m over-thinking this, but when a film moves this comfortably, without much fuss, it is only natural to wonder whether the true events on which this is based was really this tame.

That said, the delightful, uplifting moments are an absolute joy to watch. The beautifully designed whales, which look incredibly realistic, were in fact, puppets, controlled by hydraulics and robotic technology. Even the small, minute details are paid attention to, most notably on the youngest whale that becomes severely injured. His scarring, as well as his weakened movement are captured so well that you would mistake it for being a real-life animal. Barrymore and the highly reliable Krasinski make a nice couple, with supporting players Ted Danson, Dermot Mulroney and Bell all chipping in to complete a more than watchable ensemble. Big Miracle is sweet, often funny and touching: a trifecta needed for every family film to entertain the parents as well as the kids.
