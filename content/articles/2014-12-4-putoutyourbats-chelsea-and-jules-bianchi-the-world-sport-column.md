Cricketer Phillip Hughes was laid to rest at his funeral in his hometown in Macksville, New South Wales, on Wednesday. Australian captain Michael Clarke gave an emotional eulogy after acting as a pall bearer. Hughes, who would have turned 26 on Sunday, was struck by a bouncer last Tuesday, and died on Thursday afternoon, after an artery burst in his neck. The Test Series between Australia and India has been subsequently rearranged. Adelaide, Hughes adopted home ground, will now host the first test, with Brisbane hosting the second. A twitter hashtag, #putoutyourbats, has become a global phenomenon, with many leaving their bats outside with a cap on the handle in tribute.

Last week Brendon McCullum, wearing a PH (Phil Hughes) on his shirt, became only the second player in history after Don Bradman to score two double centuries and a triple century in a calendar year.England beat Sri Lanka in the third One-Day-International in Hambantota on Duckworth-Lewis to keep themselves in the series.

Chelsea dominated against Tottenham in the Premier League to secure a 3-0 win. Manchester City and Manchester United won, whilst Southampton fell to a second consecutive defeat, this time at the hands of Arsenal.

England overcame Australia to win their final Autumn International 26-17. Wales beat South Africa to register only their second victory against a Rugby Championship side under Warren Gatland.

Sam Burgess, who has recently switched codes from Rugby League to Rugby Union, made his debut last Friday, coming on off the bench in a win for Bath against Harlequins.

An accident report has found that Jules Bianchi “did not slow sufficiently” in the lead up to the accident that left him in a coma in the Japanese Grand Prix. In other news, double points has now been abandoned for next season’s Formula One season.
