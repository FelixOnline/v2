Spring is slowly starting to set in in London, and although we’re not feeling the mini-skirt wearing heat yet, these trends work for the transiton stage between winter and summer. On a cooler day, carry around a chunky knit sweater to ward off the occasional chills of the British spring time, and don’t forget to keep a portabe umbrella with you in your hanbag, because one things for sure in this city: There will be spring showers!

Crop tops

Crop tops are a cute and girly spring trend. They’re showing up on the desinger runways and all the high street fashion stores and you can find them anywhere from H and M to Alexander McQueen. On a warm day, rock it with a cardigan, and on a cooler day, you can still wear the trend with a cropped sweater.

Jogger trousers

This loose style of trouser is perfect for spring - not as heavy as jeans but still not as exposing as as a pair of shorts. They’re ideal for the milder weather, and not to mention, they’re super comfortable!

Skater dresses

Skater dresses are the easiest dress style to pull off in the warmer months. They’re loose and breezy and flatter all body shapes thanks to their A line skirt that skims over the hips and smooths out any bumps. Dress up a simple style (like the one above) with some bright accessories.

Sandals

This season, the metallic trend is big. Sandals in gold or silver hues are great for dressing up casual looks. If you’re not big on shiny shoes, you can go for basic black sandals with jewelled details to dress up your outfit.

Statement necklace

A statement necklace is the perfect way to accessorise a simple look. Go for a a colourful one if you’re accesorising plain black or white outfits.
