The last Last Exorcism certainly was not the “last” as it is followed by this pretty disastrous sequel that is somehow trying to bridge a gap for a potential third entry to turn the franchise into a trilogy – because any mildly successful horror series must at least have three.

Once again we have the same girl who’s being pursued by a relentless demon that is determined to possess an innocent, pure body so that it can have its wicked, supernatural ways. Yes, Nell (Bell) is having difficulties running away from her troubled past, in which she was forced into a part of a creepy satanic cult that ended with a botched exorcism (aren’t they always?) followed by a twisted, demented birthing ceremony in the middle of a huge bonfire. Ending with a cliffhanger (always a safe choice), we thought we would never have to hear from them again, putting a sensible finish to a surprisingly good horror film.

And yet trying to milk the franchise for as much cash as possible, here’s the sequel, in which very little happens, and one that is frustratingly toned down when it comes to the shock factor. Having moved into a home for lost/traumatised girls (all of them automatically turning into a long list of victims), Nell is settling in working away diligently as a hotel chambermaid although it’s not long until the usual frightening occurrences start haunting her. You know, the usual bumpy things, twisty body contortion movements, frothy seizures, demonic voices, weird eye colouring/movements etc.

The first instalment was an excellent use of the handheld-camera technique, but with this follow-up, the style is completely gone and lost, falling back to the old standard way of filming without ever providing something else for the audience to enjoy. The scares are all very generic and a lot of them without much memorable impact. There are a few effective moments, ones that really ought to have been present more consistently throughout.

It’s unclear to see just where the film is headed and when it does end up in its big final showdown, (yes, yet another botched exorcism, what else?) you’re in for a big disappointment. As a complete unimaginative rehash minus the stylistic push, it all feels tedious and repetitive, one you wouldn’t feel like enduring. It’s no fun when there’s a complete lack of mystery as to what is happening – as from the previous film we’ve learned all there is to know about this omnipotent evil force.

Bell doesn’t seem to have any difficulty slipping back into her breakout role, although everyone else around her stands around rather awkwardly equipped only with their clunky dialogue to fend for themselves. Bell’s purely innocent and completely clueless nature is always fun to watch as we sense that she’s been marked for all sorts of bad things even from the very start. As Nell completely falls apart thanks to the demon, this gives Bell a real chance to show off her talent and she shows that she really belongs in better films.

Perhaps if another sequel is given the go-ahead signal, it will allow the franchise a chance to stir things up and go all-out for a truly shocking finish. After all, this Part II ends on a cliffhanger with much potential, one that could surely be developed further, venturing into more daring territory that might certainly be worth a look, unlike this dull, pedestrian piece of work.
