Over the last few years Croatia’s coast on the Adriatic has become the go-to spot for electronic music festivals. This year the organisers of Field day, Warehouse Project and Hideout are bringing a fresh party to the region, Unknown.

The festival promises a line up that’s guaranteed to deliver. Live acts include Disclosure, Fourtet, Jessie Ware and The Horrors whilst Kerri Chandler, Joy Orbison, Floating Points, Jackmaster, Oneman, Jamie XX and many more will be DJing.

Besides big names, Unknown promises boat parties, pool parties and a whole load of installations courtesy of Mad Ferret Productions, Kid Acne, Unit 44 and others.

The festival runs from the 10th-14th September. Tickets are selling at £109.00 plus booking fee and can be purchased here:
