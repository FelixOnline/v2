This week, the Union opened nominations for the upcoming elections for its part- and full-time positions. [The Big Elections 2013](https://www.union.ic.ac.uk/elections/), as the Union are publicising them, are this year the stage for 56 people to be chosen to represent Imperial students in their respective capacities.

Nominations opened on the 4th February, and at the time of writing many people have already been nominated according to the “Big Elections” website. The fact that there are already five people who have been nominated for ICU President also shows that the competition is hotting-up.

This should not deter any would be candidates, who still have until 23.59 on the night of the 3rd of March to go online and nominate themselves. For everybody to get involved in, the actual voting opens at 12:00 on Friday the 8th March and closes a week later on the 15th March. The final results will be announced at the Results Party in [Metric ](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/food-drink/metric)the same evening.
