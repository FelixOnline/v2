In my opinion, the __ICA__ is simply not appreciated enough. It is on the front line of contemporary art and this means that, although all shows aren’t guaranteed to thrill (such is the risk of pushing boundaries!), you will have an exciting time no matter what — much better this than the rather soulless blockbuster shows of the __Tate__.

And so I am greeted by Viviane Sassen’s latest exhibition _Pikin Slee_. A true innovator in fashion photography, Sassen abstracts her work to create pieces that transcend all notion of orthodoxy. We last saw her at __The Photographer’s Gallery__, her exhibition _Analemma_, which explored her work in art fashion photography. But her current exhibition at the __ICA__ represented a very different body of her work.

In 2013, Sassen travelled to Suriname, deep into the jungle to a town where the only outside contact was via canoe — _Pikin Slee_. Here, she documents a world completely alien to her own, the life of the Saramacca people, a traditional way of life where the beauty of nature reigns supreme.

It is not a particularly large collection of works; the __ICA__ is not a particularly large venue; but the exhibition manages to display many aspects of the beauty of this little town. From portraits and documents of the mundane to more abstract pieces, such as the incredible _Warrior_, an anthropomorphic arrangement of palm fronds that trick the eye into seeing something that does not exist.

These are the Sassen works that I love, the ones that completely reinvent what one might expect to perceive, whether in fashion photography or in nature. And I do not mind her liberal use of Photoshop. She creates a modernity and dynamism in images that would otherwise pass me by.

However, this body of work only represents a small proportion of what is displayed. The rest I unfortunately found less impressive. Yes it was well shot, well composed, but it didn’t have that unique Sassen signature that you see written all over her fashion photography. Maybe it’s just me who doesn’t get it but photos of buckets and puddles just don’t do it for me!

Would I make a special point of seeing this display, probably not. Although it does have moments that are unlike any other depiction of rainforest communities I have seen, much of the rest is less fantastic. However, if you are going to the Dor Guez exhibition, it may be worth popping your head in. Otherwise, just stick to her fashion photography.

_Viviane Sassen: Pikin Slee is at the ICA until 12th April. Tickets £1, free on Tuesdays._
