On the 1st March, the call of Newquay found SurfSoc packing into a minibus for our second trip of 2013. Already full and with two people still to pick up at Bristol, we battled on through the Friday traffic towards our goal: the sea (and Belushi’s). At Bristol, we stocked up on passengers, port and WKD with Carly Rae on full volume. The creation of the ‘social seat’ and a few Cheeky Vimto’s later, the atmosphere began to heat up and soon the whole minibus was skanking to Radio1’s Friday Nite Dubstep Bangerz. Big up to Alex ‘Karbs’ Karvelas for not crashing at this point while Adam ‘Hardcore’ Harvey was gyrating in his face! However, Karbs became progressively less composed as the frequency of toilet stops “on the side of a f***ing road” increased but at around 1am we finally rolled into our destination. The night was still young though, and there was still time for many Jaeger bombs and games of International Cock or Ball before the Belushi’s staff began to tire of our antics and we finally resigned ourselves to bed.

Disaster struck on Saturday morning with the realisation that Hardcore had lost his coat with the minibus keys in while raving with some new Polish friends. I dread to think what the combined effect of that nervous ‘shitting myself’ feeling and the hangover had on his bowels. But luckily it turned out Dario ‘A-frame’ Mazza had them all along. With the panic over and many small but perfectly formed waves surfed (apart from by those who were too ill to get in the water/ had locked their wetsuit in the minibus), a quick nap was had before fines commenced. As well as customary drinking, the main activity of Saturday night was grazing. Being the only girl on the trip, Lucy Bareback fell victim to repeated rounds of abuse and by the end of the night, had pretty crispy locks. Dolled up Sailors punters did not take having their hair chewed so lightly though, which nearly led to Zombie John being escorted from the premises. The night finished with a star appearance by Professor Bean, whose explanations of palaeontology ensured that everyone enjoyed an ‘integrated learning process’ as a bedtime story.

The waves were pretty non-existent on Sunday morning, which was just as well because no one had set an alarm. Having missed check-out time and breakfast, there was only one thing to do: get back in the water anyway. The bracing water was enough to reviveus despite the lack of waves, and after a few hours (or 20 minutes in one case) we were ready for hot chocolates and more Belushi’s burgers. Manny and Dangermouse just couldn’t get enough of the salty liquid though, and managed to stay out on Fistral for an impressive 5 hours. We reluctantly returned to London tired but in high spirits after another successful SurfSoc session.
