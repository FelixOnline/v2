So summer has finally arrived and it’s time to pack up our precious belongings and start travelling. Whether it’s lugging a heavy laptop to the office, or, for those more fortunate, a chance to explore the world with SLRs slung around our necks, there’s no doubt that expensive pieces of technology are slowly swirling into the epicentre of our lives.

Of course this all means one thing: time to buy bags! It would be a crime to not protect all of this expensive hardware upon which we base our lives around, yet unfortunately shops seem somewhat lacking in this department. Nevertheless, that does not mean there isn’t a bag out there to suit every person’s needs, just take care to choose the bag that best represents YOU.

If you’re travelling the world with plenty of equipment this beast will be your saviour. Sturdy, well padded, and most definitely spacious, it can fit a 15” laptop, an SLR body, and 3 lenses AT ONCE. It has configurable Velcro dividers and a plethora of pockets, which are great for anyone wanting to look professional, and did I mention it’s weather-resistant too?

Quirky and cute, this is for all of the beginners out there whose standard clutch is just not big enough for their new SLR. With enough space for the basics, this offers a fun alternative to the standard lug-around bags, and you may even have space for your make-up kit too.

[THE PRACTICAL ONE](http://www.jill-e.com/collections/classic-collection/everywear-gadet-bag-nougat)

With a special iPad pocket and big enough for your basic SLR kit, but small enough to also be used as an everyday bag, this is a bag for the practical traveller who prefers a handbag to a rucksack. It even has handy pockets for your essentials and space too for an umbrella and your make-up; the only downside is that lightweight weather resistance called for a nylon exterior.

With its inconspicuous matte black surface and practical shape, the Union Kit Messenger is no doubt a bag for tourists. Big enough for entry level SLRs and a lens as well as having secure zippers and fastenings, this padded tech bag will help keep your kit safe.
