As students at Imperial, we love good extra-curricular science, right? Right? I guess we can be excused from crawling out of the Library once in a while and going straight to bed as opposed to the nearest museum. But every so often, there are some great gems out there to take part in, usually right on our doorstep.

The Natural History Museum currently runs a series of 30-minute lectures concerning all things bright and beautiful, in their lecture theatre that the Business School would be proud of. These talks make up their programme called Nature Live, which offers talks and events for anyone to go to, for free. The Attenborough Studio is situated in the modern glass atrium of the museum and hosts these packed introductory titbits into what is going on behind the scenes, usually to everyone’s complete

unawareness. Over 300 scientists work on various endeavours throughout the museum covering many branches of research, and having an insight into what they are doing, alongside learning something along the way, makes these bite-sized sessions highly enjoyable.

Last Friday the lecture “What is your posion… or venom?” was presented by [Dr Ronald Jenner](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/about-science/staff-directory/life-sciences/r-jenner/index.html), whose research into poisonous organisms may hopefully lead to understanding of their hidden potential medicinal properties. After presenting a stimulating introduction into what is a poison and a venom and the differences between the two, he went on to explain in more detail how these occur in nature and then onto how this could apply to us. The lecture was fast paced, engaging and not too overwhelming at all to the younger members of the audience, who posed no end of thought-provoking questions

throughout that even at times left Dr Jenner stumped. The science ranged from stuffed models to molecules, ensuring all of the audience, whether a small scientist in the making, or a visiting student learnt something new and didn’t feel patronised or out of their depth.

With Dr Jenner currently working to find the first poisonous crustacean, whilst looking into venom-derived compounds to treat diabetes, such expertise is not to go unmentioned. These scientists know their stuff, and such lectures provide brilliant opportunities to talk to them unbridled and really get to know what is going on behind the scenes. These talks also allow an insight into field courses and the research they are currently doing, supplemented by blogs online showing the research in action. It’s great for aspiring ecologists to check out at the moment with an online blog being updated from a recent trip to Borneo. Still can’t bring yourself to leave the Library? Check online for videos of previous talks and events if you can’t make the trip around the corner.

However don’t be put off from attending if you think it is all about the biology. Upcoming talks include “A Body of Evidence,” which is given by a forensic anthropologist throughout the day on the 23rd of November, and “Meteorites: Messengers from Space,” on the 28th of November, which may be more to the taste of a physicist or mathematician, or simply any student who wants to feed their inner nerd. Talks are either family friendly or more suitable for adults, so choose wisely if you fancy taking a younger sibling if they come to visit. These are great events to supplement a day trip to the museum, or if you just have an afternoon to kill and fancy something a lot more interesting and stimulating than the Library Café’s cake selection.

Check online at[ www.nhm.ac.uk](http:// www.nhm.ac.uk) to see the full list of upcoming Nature Live talks. No booking is required, just turn up!
