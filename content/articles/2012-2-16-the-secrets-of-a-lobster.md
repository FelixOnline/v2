The next time you see live lobsters at a restaurant market, don’t be afraid of them! You will see that they’re pretty easy to cook and enjoy.

Lobsters are very expensive though, and that is not only because they are very popular, but because it’s very difficult to find them. They live in holes and caves in deep waters and don’t get out of them very often.

There are two kinds of lobsters; the first one lives in warm waters and has no callipers and the second one lives in cold waters and has two enormous ones. Keep in mind that a lobster should be alive to have a good taste when you will cook it, as the lobster’s meat quality is altered very, very quickly. If you feel guilty boiling them alive (although some people believe that the nervous system of a lobster is too simple for it to feel any pain at all), put them in the freezer for 20 minutes to let them become numb and then boil them.

Female lobsters are more tasty than male ones and here is the way to distinguish between the two; if you compare a male and a female lobster of approximately the same size, the female one has a wider tail to allow some space for its eggs.

In order to boil your lobster, you will need salty water, enough to cover the lobster completely. Grasp the live lobster behind the claws and drop it head-first into the boiling water. Boil the lobster for 10 minutes for the first lb of weight and then three more minutes for each extra pound. Once cooked, drain the lobster immediately and serve hot.

You shouldn’t serve the lobster as it is, try to make your guests’ lives easier. You can either use lobster crackers to crack the shell in order to reach the meat or cut the claws and the lobster in half with a sturdy knife.

Whichever your choice, make sure you enjoy it with the right person!
