In an email sent out earlier this month to undergraduate students expecting to graduate this year, the College announced a change from usual procedures for the annual ceremony.

The graduation day, known as Commemoration Day to commemorate the visit of Queen Victoria to the Royal College of Chemistry in 1845, is usually held on a Wednesday in October.

However, this year the ceremony will take place on Monday 19th.

In its email, the College described the change as necessary in order to “enable all graduating students to attend”. It goes on to say, “A fifth of graduating students have visas with an expiry date in advance of the date previously considered.”

A separate email sent out to all College staff advised lecturers that mitigation would be put in place to cater for the disruption to teaching, since more classes take place on a Monday than a Wednesday, as all students have Wednesday afternoons off for sports practices.

Whilst students usually have a free day during Commemoration Day, likely as staff are busy taking part in the ceremonies or in the various receptions for graduating students, some students last year still had some academic commitments during the day.
