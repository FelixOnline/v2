__The Spectacular Now__

Director: James Ponsoldt
 Writers: Scott Neustadter, Michael H. Weber, Tim Tharp (novel)
 Starring: Miles Teller, Shailene Woodley, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Kyle Chandler
 Runtime: 95 minutes
 Certification: R (USA)

Here is a delightfully charming high-school drama in which the characters talk, think, and look like teenagers. Every now and then we are lucky enough to be treated to some excellent films that involve coming-of-age stories (Clueless, 10 Things I Hate About You, Mean Girls, Easy A), so it was about time we had another one of these, and The Spectacular Now certainly fits the bill.

It starts with Sutter (Teller) having to do what all high-school students must dread: the college application essay. He’s supposed to write about any difficulties and hardship he’s faced in life. With plenty of examples to give, he starts typing away, giving us plenty of humourous insight into his life that has so far been far from ordinary.

He thinks he’s happy with his current girlfriend, and he thinks she’s happy too, until he finds that she’s been going to parties without him and instead with the high-school quarterback. Already quite the big fan of booze and having a constant light buzz wherever he goes (he has a handy little metallic flask he carries with him), Miles goes through one night of particular drunken debauchery that ends with him passing out on a stranger’s front yard, to be awoken the next morning by Aimee (Woodley).

So now the boy’s met the girl - and the subsequent development of their relationship is quite simply the most adorable thing you’re likely to see this year. It naturally progresses from a slightly awkward friendship stemming from the boy’s need to have geometry explained to him, to something more, then to a more romantic one, with first kiss, sex, the prom, planning for the future, all thrown in there.

Also helping are the spot-on performances by the two young actors who appear so natural and comfortable in their roles. Every minute they’re together, they seem to be enjoying each other’s presence, as is the audience. They laugh, share jokes and family stories as they bond, and every minute of their blossoming romance feels heart-warmingly genuine.

Yes, family is another aspect that plays an important part in fully drawing out Miles’ character. Raised by his single mother who works as a nurse (Jason Leigh) and isn’t always necessarily there, he wonders where his father may be and what he’s getting up to. Finding his father, and having a decent conversation is what he longs for, and when he does turn up in the form of a scruffy-looking Kyle Chandler, the result is far from something he wanted. The adults surrounding Miles, including Mary Elizabeth Winstead as his married older sister who he barely sees, all pitch in brilliant performances that further shape the film with touching drama.

Aside from being told that she has an overbearing mother who wants her daughter around forever to help with her newspaper route job, Aimee’s family life is talked about but barely seen, an aspect which should have been explored more, to give an even balance in the two leads.

The bittersweet nostalgia of having to grow up and face the world out there is the inevitable theme the film must address, as Miles is quite happy enough sitting back and relaxing in his little town that everyone else cannot wait to leave behind. It’s of course a familiar message we’ve seen many times before, but ending the film is a brilliant closing montage with an effective voiceover from Sutter, beautifully weaving together everything he’s learned over the course of the film’s running time, which is plenty.
