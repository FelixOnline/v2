Sunny weather greeted the Women’s hockey team at Harlington as we took first push back,. The RSM supporters had no competition with CSM for being the loudest. 

We had a strong start from the attack, with majority possession for the first 15 minutes of the game. Unfortunately we had a lull where CSM scored their first 3 goals. But this didn’t stop us, we managed to turn the ball around and, for the first time in four years, scored our first goal! 

This lifted our spirits and spurred us to try and pull it back and beat CSM. Our defence and attack both fought hard, trying to prevent them from getting their next goal. In the second half, with CSM 4-1 up, the RSM crowd were roaring and we got off to yet again a strong start, and about half way through we got another goal! 

With a few more unfortunate CSM goals due to their fast turnarounds we finished the match with a 7-2 score. Even though this was a loss we definitely did the game justice and with such a strong team, CSM didn’t know what had hit them. We worked so hard and most importantly we had a really fun game, it was a win for us!
