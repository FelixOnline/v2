10 acts, 3 judges, 1 night and a whole lot of fun! This year’s Imperial’s Got Talent has proved to be bigger and better than ever before and has raisedover £1700 for IC Save the Children. Our finalists gave us an amazing show with joint third place going to Jessica Haddon and Esther Berry representing Pole Dancing Society and Kasia Pietrzykowska’s Hula Hoop act. In second place we had Wellington Tsu performing a body-popping dance and the winner of Imperial’s Got Talent 2013 was... Vidish Athavale doing a Michael Jackson mash-up dance! The judges had many things to say about each performance with the RAG President David Goldsmith commenting that he loved the Belly Dancing act, Union President Paul Beaumont saying he was ‘moved’ by the Piano act and our Save the Children President Yang Liu left speechless after the UK national yo-yo champion performed. With a guest appearance from Cameron Jay, who has performed with Emilie Sande, a mega raffle draw and crazy after-party, we can happily say that this year’s Imperial’s Got Talent was the best ever! A massive thank you to everyone who came down and to the performers who helped us raise such a substantial amount of money for the charity. We hope to see you all there next year!
