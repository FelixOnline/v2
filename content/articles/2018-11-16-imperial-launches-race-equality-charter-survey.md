Imperial College London  is in the process of producing an action plan to apply for the Race Equality Charter (REC) award and, to launch this process, staff and students are being invited to complete a 10-minute confidential survey. This, in conjunction with the publication of the College's Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Strategy and Imperial College Union's ongoing work with its Liberation Review, forms part of a concerted effort across College and the Union to improve the representation, success and expreience of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) staff and students at Imperial. The REC survey opens on 12th November and closes on 1st December.

The Equality Challenge Unit (ECU)'s Race Equality Charter aims to improve the representation, progression and success of minority ethnic staff and students within higher education by providing a framework through which institutions work to identify and self-reflect on institutional and cultural barriers standing in the way of minority ethnic staff and students. Member institutions, such as Imperial, develop initiatives and solutions for action, and can apply for a Bronze or Silver REC award, depending on their level of progress. Institutions are required to re-apply for the award every three years with additional renewal requirements.

The Bronze award, which Imperial is seeking, recognises universities with a solid foundation for eliminating racial inequalities and developing an inclusive culture that values all staff and students. It acknowledges commitment and preparation to act. According to ECU, Bronze institutions are characterised by "their candid understanding of how race equality is perceived within their institution and a thorough acknowledgment of issues that exist for minority ethnic staff and students, their identification of context-specific priorities for race equality work with a clear understanding of their aims and what success looks like, a comprehensive, evidence-based action plan, underpinning the institutionâ€™s race equality priorities and aims, and having institution-wide senior and middle management commitment to advancing race equality demonstrated through their involvement with this work, ownership of actions and the allocation of adequate resources".

Imperial has established a Self Assessment Team - a panel comprising 20 people from across the university, including individuals from a variety of ethnic backgrounds and a balance of students, full and part-time staff representing each of the faculties and relevant central departments. An introductory meeting was held on 1st November and topics including aspects relating to attracting more BAME applicants were discussed. David Tyoember, the Black and Minority Ethnic Students Officer and member of the Self Assessment Team, commented: 

"The results of this survey will greatly aid in providing the College with critical insights needed in our work towards forming an Imperial community that is more inclusive, more welcoming and free from racism and discrimination."

The Self Assessment Team plans to meet on a termly basis, with the next meeting scheduled for January, following the closing of the survey.
