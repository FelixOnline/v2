Following the fire that engulfed Grenfell Tower in the early hours last Wednesday, claiming 17 lives and injuring many more, some critically, Imperial College set up clothes and bedding donation points at the main entrance to the South Kensington campus and in White City at the Gradpad Wood Lane Studios.

A statement released on Imperial’s website wrote: ”Our thoughts are with those affected by the fire at Grenfell Tower. The residents are our neighbours and community. We are deeply saddened by the incident and determined to help where we can.
We are working with local councillors and the community to provide support, including accommodation.”

Thanks to the efforts of Londoners over the past two days, Imperial is no longer collecting item donations. However monetary donations are more than welcome. You can donate at The Borough of Kensington and Chelsea’s dedicated website, the Evening Standard and The Kensington and Chelsea Foundation.

The A40 Westway has reopened, but some local roads remain closed, so congestion are high. Tube service has resumed.
