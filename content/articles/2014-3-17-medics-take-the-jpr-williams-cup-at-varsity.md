Imperial Medicals RFC regained the JPR Williams Cup with a comprehensive 37-11 victory over Imperial College Union RFC in the flagship rugby union match under the floodlights at the Twickenham Stoop. The day wasn’t all bad for ICU however, as they won Varsity as a whole with more victories than ICSMSU across the 29 matches. The rugby union was dominated by the Medics, with further victories in the Women’s and 3rd XV only blotted by an ICU victory for the 2nds. The same happened in the Netball, where, with the exception of the 2nd and 3rd teams, the Medics ran out comfortable winners.

Imperial College came up with some strong performances of their own, taking victory in both Badminton matches, as well as in the tennis. In the hockey, College also proved to be successful, taking four out of the five games (they lost in the Men’s 2nd match 6-1 to the Medics). In the football, the Medics were unable to find the net in any of their games, losing three and playing out a 0-0 draw in the 4th XI fixture. Despite this, the most one-sided affair seems to have come from the Basketball. In the men’s match at the Copper Box two weeks ago, the College came through 62-26. However, in the Women’s fixture it was to be even more one sided, with the College running out winners 92-9. In stark contrast the closest encounter came in the Lacrosse game where the College snuck through 8-7. Read reports and reaction in full next week.
