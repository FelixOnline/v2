Drinking, Dancing and Dining is the motto of this place - a place where you can drop in after a walk at Covent Garden market and have a tasty and relatively cheap Mexican meal. There are fantastically named cocktails, like “Orgasm please!” and “Blow work”, and tunes blasting from 11pm until 3am.

This is a place to have a drink to get some rest after the endless hours of revision or just celebrate the end of exams. During the ‘Happy Hours’ there are offers for house spirits from £2.95, selected cocktail jugs from £9.95 and bottles of wine at 20% off. Food is also provided with reasonable prices and offers are available most of the times.

Los Locos is one of the best venues in the area for seasonal and special occasions, for example Hen parties and Stag nights, private hire, great meal deals and party menus. The atmosphere cheers you up, especially if you like the Club and Party Classics that are being played a lot. If you visit the place on Tuesday or Wednsday you’ll find yourself in a ‘Wicked Student Night’ with student drinks deals all night, but there’s also free entry for girls on Thursday.

The bar is open Tuesday–Saturday, 5pm–3am, and the restaurant is open Tuesday–Saturday, 5–11pm. The club nights are Tuesday–Saturday, 11pm–3am.
