Taking on medics at netball is always a daunting task and coming up against King’s Medics was no different to the norm. Tensions were high amongst the girls before the game had even got underway due to the umpires running late however, the team soon found thir rhythm once the match began.

The whistle blew and the match opened with some good passes from both teams with our shooters Tamar and Nicole on form as always. In the words of GKT “there is nothing that can be done about that shooter!”. Standards slipped slightly as GKT took the lead but we soon gained that back with some impressive spirit and teamwork. As Bernice was celebrating her 21st birthday, the team knew that the option of losing and ruining her big day was not an option.

The match continued with IC playing a fantastic game throughout, reminding GKT of the rules when perhaps they had forgotten them. Hard, accurate passes meant that we maintained possession leading to our eventual win.

During the match there were a few disagreements between GKT and one of our umpires, so our opposition decided to play dirty. The IC girls were able to step up to this challenge with fantastic interceptions as always from WDs Rachel Zaborski and Sorcha Cotter aiding our winning campaign.

As the final ball was thrown to the GKT semi-circle our GD, Bernice, and their GA went for the ball...Well, Bernice went for the ball; the GA decided that the aim of netball is to take out the opposition.

With a crunch of an ankle and a bang of a hip, Bernice went down furiously uttering the words “if this means I can’t wear heels on Friday!” (for you that don’t know that is when the Netball Christmas Dinner is!) Nice to know that even with an icepack expertly strapped to her pink socks with selotape, which had been carefully applied by Sorcha Cotter, Bernice knows her priorities!

With the match over and the umpires paid, Bernice hobbled off to spend the rest of her 21st Birthday in style at Chelsea and West A & E.
