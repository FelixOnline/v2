__Football__

_Sunday 21st December: _

_Liverpool vs Arsenal. _

Liverpool have had a poor start to the season, and Arsenal have not looked secure, despite qualifying for the last 16 in the Champions League.

_Sunday 28th December: _

_Tottenham v Man Utd. _

Right in the middle of the busy Christmas season, this game will be important. United are currently in the Champions League places but haven’t performed overly well. Mauricio Pochettino and his Tottenham side have had a poor start to the season.

_Saturday 3rd January: _

_FA Cup third round. _

Expect numerous ‘cupsets’, as the Premier League and Championship teams enter this fabled competition.

__Cricket__

_Tuesday 6th January: _

_Australia v India. _

The third test match in this series is admittedly also during the holidays (it starts on Boxing day), but the Sydney Test match will probably be an emotional affair. The home state of Phillip Hughes, who tragically passed away two weeks ago, will play host to its first International game since the fatal accident.

__Tennis__

_Monday 5th January: _

_The start of the tennis season. _

The tennis season begins in earnest on the 5th January, with tournaments in China, India, New Zealand, Brisbane and Qatar. If men’s tennis is your cup of tea, then turn your attention to Doha, where the top players begin warming up for the Australian Open. The best of the women’s players will be travelling to Brisbane, so be sure to take a look at that as well.

__Golf__

_Thursday 8th January: _

_USPGA tour begins. _

The Hyundai Tournament of Champions begins in Kapalua, Hawaii in America on the 8th January. It is the first tournament of 2015.
