###  The Descendants

___Director __Alexander Payne
__Screenwriters __Alexander Payne, Nat Faxon, Jim Rash
__Cast __George Clooney, Shailene Woodley, Amara Miller_

Clooney is an actor who seems to push the boundaries as he ages. Although known for playing slick and suave characters, here he is in _The Descendants,_ a warm and modest family drama in which the confirmed bachelor of Hollywood plays a dedicated father of two, living in Hawaii. The twist is that his wife ends up in a coma after a water-skiing accident. He even admits that he’s been the back-up parent in their marriage. But it appears the responsibility is suddenly on him now. Not that he minds, of course; he just doesn’t have a clue on how to go about this.

His elder daughter Alex(andra) (Shailene Woodley), the rebellious teen who drinks and experiments with drugs, is far from pleased that her loser of a dad is now her full-time guardian. The younger daughter, Scottie (Amara Miller) is a cheerful little firecracker, but not so little that she does not understand what is happening with her mother. Being young and full of imaginations, she does do and say some outrageous things, something Matt (Clooney) doesn’t quite know how to handle.
 The plot thickens however, as Matt discovers his wife’s infidelity. This comes as a complete shock to him, even more so when the news is broken to him by Alex. He’s devastated for sure, but how can you be angry towards a comatose woman? The simple answer is, he can’t, and like any man on earth, he tries to track down “the other man,” but perhaps not for the same reason most men would.

Even in the midst of quite a serious turn of events, Payne makes sure to inject some off-beat humour to keep a healthy tone and pace. It never turns into a serious tragedy, nor does it veer towards hysterical comedy. There is certainly no room for any slap-stick comedy. The film speaks from the heart, and the laughs are an added bonus. Payne has had successes in the past with films such as Sideways and About Schmidt, about ordinary men going through unusual events, and “The Descendants” does not stray far from what he is used to, but has original themes of its own. It has a stronger focus on family for sure, as well as that difficult concept of life and death, with forgiveness and redemption attached.

Carrying the entire film on his shoulders is the invaluable Clooney, who makes the task look so easy. It may not be a particularly dramatic or showy role, but playing the complexities of an ordinary husband and father faced with unimaginable challenges, Clooney is a force to be reckoned with. He has the confidence and likable qualities to create a charismatic and unique central hero. His interaction with his daughters is a heart-warming one, as he develops stronger bonds with his girls.

Just because his wife is in a coma, doesn’t mean the world stops. Life goes on, and Matt has not only his daughters to worry about, but also his work. He’s a lawyer, taking care of his large family’s enormous estate fortune, and an important legal decision needs to be made – the family wants the land sold before a certain deadline, so they can be millions of dollars richer. But Matt’s not quite sure, and the pressure from his family starts to build up. Everyone dresses in colourful shirts, shorts and flip-flops; but this doesn’t mean they’re light-hearted when it comes to doing business.

The real surprise, however, comes in the form of the two young actresses who, even with very little screen experience, absolutely nail their supporting roles. Their chemistry with Clooney is more than just convincing, as the three of them settle so well into portraying a dysfunctional family. The news of their mother hits them both hard, and Woodley never overplays the rebellious side of her character, and it is impressive to see a complex role written for a teenager handled so well by the young actress. She has bitter feelings towards everyone given her situation, but is grown-up enough to understand that during the more serious moments in her life, she needs to step up. Payne also uses Miller’s Scottie well, placing someone young in a position of having to deal with her mother’s impending death.

Set in Hawaii, the audience is very often treated to some remarkable sights of the beautiful island, which is a bonus, really, to the gentle, almost therapeutic view of family life painted by the always consistent Payne. If you don’t like his patient style, The Descendants is not a film that will change your views on this unique director, but for those who have been following his work, this is another rare treat that you cannot afford to miss.
