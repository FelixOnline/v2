__What made you run for this position?__

I’m very keen to use my experience (as both a user and as a trustee) to improve services for all our members. For club & society finances and approvals, I want to approach everything with a “how can we get this done” attitude.

__What is the main change you would like to implement if elected?__

As per my manifesto, I want all our revenue to be maximised so it can go into clubs. I think we’re really missing a trick by not having a donations box on Club shop webpages. If there’s an Imperial alumnus out there who wants to give money to “X Society” or whoever, we should make it as easy as possible for them to do so. In a tax-efficient manner too - we are a charity after all.

__What is your favourite thing about Imperial?__

It’s the people here. They’re resourceful and talented – not just at science either. Recent examples that blew me away being our A Capella groups and the ICSMSU Arts Revue - really top-notch performances that would beat most arts universities hands-down.

__What is the biggest challenge you foresee in the next year?__

Time. How do I maximise the time I have for students, many of whom work 9-6 every day. I know that financial approvals for events are often time sensitive, and I want to make sure I set my schedule around student needs.

__Why are you running again for a different sabbatical position?__

I think that general question was answered very well on ICTV’s Imperial Questions Live. Like any student, I want to maximise my potential and offer my knowledge and skills to the Union. It’s something I’m very passionate about and I want to contribute to.

__Why do you only care about pizza bases? What about some of the other foods that taste just as vile at the Union?__

I don’t accept that I ‘only’ care about pizza bases! I said I would review all Union food. But pizza bases is a classic example of something that should be so easy to change, yet hasn’t been. If I need a specific mandate to change it, then so be it.

__Some sources suggest that DRI was not actually successful. What evidence do you have to prove this was a financially sound event, and if it was not, how can you justify its existence? __

It was an event designed to be inclusive and that was budgeted for. In fact it did better than budget! Its existence was justified by a clear mandate to have more inclusive events, and that’s exactly what happened. The Union is for everyone, after all.
