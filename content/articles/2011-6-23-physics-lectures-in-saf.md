The College has announced an initiative to “implement a College-wide timetabling project” that could see departments sharing major lecture theatres and potentially reduce the need to build new lecture theatres.

The proposal comes out of work done by Professor Robin Leatherbarrow and his team and would see a “centralised software solution” for timetable management being implemented across Imperial.

A separate College Day Working Group, led by Professor Griffiths, has been investigating changes to the structure of the College day in past months. [Their latest proposals](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/1251/two-hour-lunchtime-could-be-abolished/) would see the lunch break reduced from two hours, to one hour.

Professor Griffiths said that she was aware of the timetabling project but rejected that it would affect “the need to review the College day.”
