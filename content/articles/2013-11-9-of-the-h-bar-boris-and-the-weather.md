Hello again.
 So, today sees the opening of the infamous h-bar, the new pub that has opened in the Sherfield building on the side of the ‘old’ Holland Bar. This is an interesting event for postgraduate students and staff members, most of whom still fondly remember the old pub.
 There are some major improvements in the new venue, including a dedicated food service, a larger drinking space, easy wheelchair access and more space for club and society activities. On the downside for PG’s and staff members they’ve lost the use of two snooker tables and they have to share part of the space with undergraduate students for a Monday–Thursday dinner service (5:30-7PM), albeit with the bar section separated by a partition. We look forward to your letters about the new h-bar, all comments welcome, whether glowing praise or long rants. Well, reasonably long rants.
 Tuesday saw the presence of Imperial regular, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson. The mayor came to campus to take part in a ‘People’s Question Time’, which was an event where the people of London had the chance to hold him to account in a public forum. Tickets were quickly snapped up and luckily Felix was able to attend, and we were even able to get an exclusive picture of the Mayor outside the library, moments before he began his cycle home.
 Finally, yes there was a colossal amount of rain for some parts of this week, it almost makes one tempted to check the weather forecast. Oh well, time to use the new umbrella.
