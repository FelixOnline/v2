1979 holds the key to the farthest reaches of musical conception. That year, [Nurse With Wound](http://brainwashed.com/nww/) released their debut album _Chance Meeting on a Dissecting Table of a Sewing Machine and an Umbrella_. Their music is the aural equivalent to the paintings of Salvador Dalí, stretching the mind and questioning reality. The surrealistic instrumentation and Dadaist approach are an amalgam of some of the strangest music of modern times. Tucked into the vinyl gatefold, the revered NWW List payed homage to their influences and bore the wonder for others to discover.

From __Henri Chopin__ to __Karlheinz Stockhausen__, through the __Velvet Underground__ and into __Tangerine Dream__, the list spans and pulls together the most unlikely of artists. Dabbling in psychedelics and staggering with no-wave drawl, rolling the rocks in one ear and out the other.

The list pays its respects to a horde of homegrown freethinkers and experimentalists such as industrial outfit __Throbbing Gristle__ and freakfolk gem __Comus__. Among other London-based groups appear __AMM__, pioneers of free-improvisation, whose founding member Eddie Prévost can be found on Sunday nights holding improvisation workshops in the basement of a chapel in Borough.

One of the most influential bands on the list is Essex-based anarcho-punks __Crass__, who cemented the conscientious and passionate cornerstones of the punk mind, burning in the grasp of Thatcherism. Taking up camp in the Dial House commune in the Essex countryside, they nurtured a creative environment for free expression, which still exists today and is documented in the film [_There is No Authority but Yourself_](http://minimovies.org/documentaires/view/crass).

Strongly represented is the psychedelic krautrock movement which sprouted in Germany at the end of the 60’s in response to the summer of love. Noting the seminal meanderings of __Can__, commune jam band __Amon Düül__ and of course one of the biggest influences on modern electronic music, __Kraftwerk__.

__John Cage__ makes an appearance as well as Greek architect-turned-composer __Iannis Xenakis__, who used the mathematics of chance and architecture in many of his works. Avant garde guitarist __Fred Frith__ is also mentioned alongside Frank Zappa’s __Mothers of Invention__.

The list is a colourful display of originality and with bands such as __The Deep Freeze____Mice__ or __Lemon Kittens__, sometimes it’s worth reading for the names alone. For the curious ear, it is a mere chip of the cookie and a musical map towards deeper horizons.
