On Sunday 2nd December an army of Santa Clauses will be taking to the streets of London. They will be marching from East to West and they’re not alone. Santas will be doing this all over other university cities too: Bristol, Nottingham, Cambridge, Bath, York, Oxford, Durham… and even New York!

[Kenyan Orphan Project ](http://www.kopafrica.org/)(KOP) and [RAG](https://union.ic.ac.uk/rag/index.php) have organised Santa-themed charity-runs (well, more of a light stroll) to raise money, increase awareness and most of all because it will be awesome. In London we’ll be starting off near King’s College (Waterloo campus) and making our way towards Imperial with stop-offs for a few antics and photo snaps at sights along the way… we’ll even manage to squeeze in a few drinks. Entry is only £5 and it all goes to charity. KOP have also launched a competition, best photo from the Santa Dashes wins a free flight to Kenya for the Student Summer Programme!

We’d like to get as many people involved as we can (to raise as much as possible and also because it’ll make Imperial look better than the other London unis!). So start getting creative with those costume ideas! Santas, snowmen, a few reindeers to pull the sleigh? Anything will do. Whether you want to do a bit of sightseeing/have the opportunity to run around London in fancy dress/spread a little bit of Christmas around town or simply help raise some money for a worthwhile cause (delete as appropriate), then come along.

The Santas will be setting off at 1pm from King’s College (Waterloo campus, exact location TBC via the Facebook event page). If you’d like get involved, email cag-kop@imperial.ac.uk or fill out the sign up form at the Facebook event[ http://tinyurl.com/c9d3nzv.](http:// http://tinyurl.com/c9d3nzv.)

KOP runs a two week student summer programme in July to work on the projects which it supports in Kenya. Applications close 1st December, visit <http://www.kopafrica.org/student-programme> for more info.
