Last Saturday saw the Immortals’ three-way scrimmage against Solent and Brunel. The Immortals were hungry for some contact after many intense training sessions. The day started off with each university’s offensive team going up against each defensive team for ten plays before switching around. This was followed by a round robin scrimmage and the day ended with special teams undergoing specific scenarios. Despite some players being inexperienced, the defensive team were strong and held off the hard-hitting Brunel and Solent offense.

Shout outs go out to our rookie D-end ‘angry’ Matthieu Raymond and our rookie linebacker Matt ‘has had enough’ Blackett for making tackles all over the field including, notably, a filthy Quarterback sack by Raymond. Even though there were some hotheaded moments, veterans “I’ve got a hot girlfriend” Rayane Jackson, Jack “Bamiiiiii” Codrey and Henry ‘Ugly Henners’ Turner landed many successful hits on the line opening up gaps for Alex Hutcherson to once again throw his body into running backs much like an averaged sized salmon jumping upstream against a waterfall.

The aforementioned veterans however, courageously guided the front seven with their determination and restlessness and set a strong pace for the defence overall.

Lastly, a mention to Wibbly Wobbly Will Coidan’s overly ambitious and not so spectacular Nodell leading to the opposing team’s interception. This was not made right by his sack on one of our own, Marin ‘wet burp’ Tuleu, after an outstanding interception, leading the opposing team’s fumble recovery.

On the other hand, the offensive team started off slowly with a few mistakes here and there but picked up towards the end. The offensive line were landing solid blocks, which led to strong contributions from our rookie wide receiver, modest Race Kilian, including, most notably, his sneaky reception in double coverage.

Special thanks to Papa Noach for finding his inner Zen during a sticky situation between Le’Bami Falana and Brunel’s sideline. Despite the tension, Falana continued to dominate the grounds after scoring touchdown after touchdown during special team drills. Finally on offense, Married Man Markus Mohr made a few above average plays too.

All in all, a great day for the Immortals with the rookies gaining a lot of experience and the returners going back into the game, we now look forward to playing against a strong Birmingham side this Saturday.
