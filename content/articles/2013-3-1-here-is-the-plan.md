Keep yourselves free on the 9th/10th of March – Imperial College Union Malaysian Society returns with Malaysian Night 2013, the annual production that’s been entertaining audiences across the UK for years. With great moves, great laughs, great music (and amazing food after!), it promises to be an unforgettable experience.

This year, follow the life of Sophie Gan: a compassionate but bitter young twenty-something whose father was wrongfully executed for the terrorist attacks in their homeland. Raised by her grandmother, Sophie’s life is turned upside down when Nolan, a snarky man claiming to be her late father’s protege, shows up at her door offering her the chance to get even. But it isn’t easy – they’re up against a corrupt politician and his equally greedy partners-in-crime, who happen to be tough nuts to crack.

For a tenner, you’ll be treated to a showcase of good ol’ Malaysian culture, humour, and our traditional Nasi Lemak after the show. Event details and tickets are available at <http://www.icmnight.com> and http://on.fb.me/icmnight2013 – we’ll see you there!
