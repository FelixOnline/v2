Now in its fourth series, _Suits _is an American legal drama that premiered in June of 2011. Created by Aaron Korsh, the first episode is one of the best pilots in recent television history.

Here’s the set up: Mike Ross (Parick J. Adams) is a bright college dropout with a photographic memory but no real future as a bike messenger.Living in New York, he makes money on the side by sitting the Law School Admission Test for strangers.

After getting pressured into paying $25,000 to keep his grandmother in a private nursing home, Mike agrees to deliver a briefcase of marijuana to a Hotel room for his close friend Trevor (Tom Lipinski).

The drug deal turns out to be a sting operation that Mike cleverly figures out before making the drop. In his efforts to escape the task force, Mike stumbles into a job interview with Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht), a Harvard educated lawyer at Pearson Hardman who is deemed to be the “best closer in New York City.”

In his recent promotion to senior partner at the firm, Harvey is expected to hire a fellow Harvard Law graduate as an associate.

Harvey starts talking to Mike, who uses his photographic memory and encyclopedic knowledge of the law to convince Harvey to employ him, despite never attending Harvard or even completing a degree.

Mike explains that he had always dreamt of being a lawyer, but lost his College scholarship after getting caught cheating on a maths exam. His friend Trevor had convinced him to memorise a maths test, but the pair unknowingly sold the answers to the Dean’s daughter. Mike had been admitted as a transfer student to Harvard for the next academic year, but the Dean’s final act before resigning was to expel Mike and tell Harvard what he did.

Mike recognizes the opportunity he has been gifted and promises Harvey that “I’ll help you school those Harvard douches, and I’ll be the best god-damn lawyer you’ve ever seen.”

Harvey decides to hire Mike and cover up the fact that he never went to Harvard Law. Shenanigans ensue.

With the job, the money, the looks and the lifestyle, Harvey is portrayed as a man’s man; the American dream realised. However, Harvey is somewhat emotionally stunted and his alpha-male bravado prevents him from having meaningful relationships with other people.

Mike’s compassionate streak and genius intellect compliment Harvey’s cold but perceptive nature to create a compelling dynamic that the series exploits throughout.

Obsessed with getting his “name on the door”, Harvey is the protégé of managing partner Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres), a strong woman in a man’s world of top tier law.

The rest of the main cast includes Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman), a hard working and pedantic junior partner who takes great pride in his work but is unpopular with the associates he trains, Rachel Zane (Meghan Markle), a paralegal at the firm and Mike’s love interest, and Donna Paulsen (Sarah Rafferty), Harvey’s loyal private secretary and close confidant who listens in on all the conversations in his office.

The first series is primarily concerned with how Mike and Harvey form an unlikely partnership while keeping the big secret.

Subsequent series deal with internal problems at the firm, including allegations of malpractice, fending off mergers, winning big cases and quashing takeover bids. With clear and distinct plot arcs, _Suits_ is heavily serialised.

_Suits _is a fast paced and witty series, with great characters that you believe in. Slick in its presentation, the series manages to retain a sense of humour even as the plot gets more serious.

The series thrives off conflict between intelligent people. Well-reasoned, heated arguments are packed into the scripts and this is what keeps you watching.

This is a show where an awful lot of things are ‘goddamn right’ and many asses are threatened to be kicked. It’s a fun show that is essential viewing for anyone with time to kill and a suit and tie fetish.

The first two series of _Suits _are on Netflix. The fourth series is currently airing on Dave.
