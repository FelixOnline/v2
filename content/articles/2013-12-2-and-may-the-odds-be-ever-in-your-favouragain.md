So it’s been about a year since the first Hunger Games film made its debut, however, the second one in the series catches up with the protagonists before a whole year has passed for them. Because just being out of the arena does not necessarily mean that you’re out of the game. Rather, after becoming the victors Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are unwittingly in the middle of some political agenda which requires them to be madly in love. Which would have been fine but for Peeta’s sheepish passivity but more so due to Katniss’ long standing love interest Gale (Liam Hemsworth) – despite the severe lack of progress on that front so far – being in the picture. And occupying quite a bit of space in the so-called picture. In spite of the positively life-threatening circumstances that unfold, the tension from the love triangle is lingering in the background which sets down the cringe-foreboding grounds for the third one especially as it will be split into two films.

However, the film is more or less faithful to the contents of the original novel that it is based on and does not make the mistake of overly dwelling on certain details whilst cutting out significant chunks and ultimately maintains appropriate balance. As fans of the series would already know, quite a bit takes place in the second volume and the film digests it all well without losing the hints and foreshadowing and, most importantly, without dragging on and on. This is also true for the introduction of new characters (Sam Claflin, Jena Malone) that will carry on into the later films where only the essential parts of their stories are told to let them intertwine skillfully with existing characters. The chemistry between the existing and new casts certainly seems convicing which is very good news for the remaining characters waiting to be introduced.

The film also packs much more of a punch in terms of action in comparison to the first film where the game seemed more of a solo camping challenge than a gladitorial fight to the death. Since this Game is a special one for which tributes are selected from the existing pool of victors you also get to see many victors with a variety of weaspons, skills and both of them in action. Understandably the handheld camera has been replaced to offer a bigger, grander picture particularly so for the scenes of the chariot sequence.

Another aspect to look forward to in this series is the fashion; Effie’s (Elizabeth Banks) outfits for the sheer outrageousness accompanied by frankly alarming attention to matching details that would make even Lady Gaga jealous – and we do get a good variety of ensembles with one truly à la Alexander McQueen! – and Katniss’ for the imaginative realisation of her symbolic costumes and makeup.
 The film ultimately comes to a significant twist of an ending setting the big scene for what is likely to be the most anticipated films over the next two years. Much remains untold and unsolved but with such steady and calm take as demonstrated in this second work I think we can reliably expect high quality feature from the cast and crew should the odds be again in their favour.
