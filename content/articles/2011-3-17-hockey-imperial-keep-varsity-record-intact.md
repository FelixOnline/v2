After watching Imperial register two wins and a draw against the Medics, there was a lot of pressure on the Men’s 1st team. Imperial played to their full potential and ran out 5-4 winners.

Imperial started in the best possible manner, winning an early short corner. Sam injected and Jaideep Desai set himself up for a huge hit that resembled a golf swing more than a hockey shot. This hit popped up in the air, and JD reacted first to the loose ball, playing in captain Ewan Quince for him to put Imperial 1-0 up.

Imperial continued their dominance and good midfield work from veteran Nick Jones led to Ewan setting up Koch for a golden chance, which sadly went straight at the keeper. The Medics soon won a short corner, which would have gone in, but for Matty J’s interception. Sadly, from the resulting short corner, the Medics converted to enter the half time at 1-1.
> It was anyone's game, and an inspirational team talk was necessary
At this stage, it was anyone's game, and an inspirational team talk from Ewan was necessary. Imperial took this to heart and early in the second half, Jones, the Finesmaster for the team, broke with outrageous pace to set up a chance that Koch put just wide.

Imperial kept knocking at the door. Another piece of beautiful play from Jones saw a cross go agonisingly past JD’s stick. All this good work was undone in one swift move as a Medic counter attack saw them win another short. Despite the best efforts of Lars, a great routine saw the Medics bury a shot into the bottom corner, just past Vish’s dive.

Imperial’s response was almost instant. Great work from Gilles on the right saw Imperial win a short corner. Tom Koch’s excellent drag flick pulled Imperial level. The Medics response was swift and deadly, with College caught napping, The Medics were ahead again. A great response from Imperial almost followed, with Ewan rattling the crossbar. This was followed up by Ewan hitting the side of the goal from a Nick Prior through ball. Imperial did not have to wait long and a hit from Gilles saw captain-elect Sam put the equaliser past the keeper.

Straight from the push off, Imperial pushed and JD converted a Jones cross to put College 4-3 up. The message was clear, be certain and composed, clearly no one told Sam who got himself a yellow and a ten minute sin-bin. Despite the Medics advantage, Imperial managed to go 5-3 up. Ewan with his back to the goal swiveled and roofed his shot into the top right. It was no less than IC deserved.

The Medics were not done and a drive down the right hand side saw the Medics score from the top of the D. No sooner did IC relinquish their one man disadvantage, did Tom Koch get himself sent off. The Medics won a short to push for an equaliser, but stern defending from Lars and Matty J. saw IC see it, and the game, out. A 5-4 win, a pulsating match and proof that, in hockey, Imperial are better than the Medics.
