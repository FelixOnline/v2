Last week, HRH Princess Chulabhorn of Thailand visited Imperial to discuss science and collaboration with students and professors. The princess, who is the youngest child of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, met Thai students as well as experts in her field of interest: medical research.

Princess Chulabhorn is well known for her keen interest in science and medicine. She has a PhD in Chemistry from Mahidol University, Bangkok.

She spoke about future collaborations between Imperial and Thailand, her own research and the importance of research in general, calling it “the key to everything”.

The princess met professors from the medical faculty’s surgery and cancer department, the School of Public Health and Electronical Engineering.

Some of the professors spoke to the princess about Imperial’s research around cholangiocarcinoma, a bile duct cancer that occurs at a high rate in Thailand in particular. Khon Kaen University Hospital is currently working with a team at Imperial on advanced imaging techniques in a bid to fight the disease.

James Stirling, the Provost, said: “Imperial College London is very proud of our links with Thailand both through students and the research that we do together. Today is a chance to celebrate that and to discuss ways we can work more closely together”.

Imperial has connections with several Thai institutions, including Mahidol, Chulalongkorn and Khon Kaen universities.
