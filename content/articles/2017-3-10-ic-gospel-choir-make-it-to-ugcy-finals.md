The Imperial College Gospel Choir (ICGC) family cordially invite you to come and support us in our attempt to make ICGC history by placing top three in the University Gospel Choir of the Year (UGCY) finals.

ICGC is a non-auditioned, relaxed choir and we pride ourselves in our ability to bring together people from a variety of backgrounds and skill levels based on a common love for singing. Our membership is open to all regardless of religious affiliation or singing experience. We also provide the opportunity for those curious about the Christian faith to find people to direct their questions to in a laid back atmosphere. We ensure that all members are well integrated and feel at home when we are together – whether we are singing at the top of our voices or stuffing our faces with food at one of our club socials.

The University Gospel Choir of the Year (UGCY) is like the World Cup for University gospel choirs and we have made the finals on 4 occasions – 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015. However, in our four previous attempts, we have not managed to place in the top three. This year we have made it to the finals again under very stiff competition with many universities forming gospel choirs in recent years. This is testament to the progression of our choir over the years and it is our hope that this year, with all the momentum we have gathered recently, we will be able to place in the top three.

Last year, we celebrated our 10th anniversary with ICGC’s biggest concert till date – welcoming over 100 spectators to St Paul’s Hammersmith. This was a turning point in the history of the club, a clear sign of ICGC’s growth and development as a choir and also as a family. The faces of ICGC continuously change but the vision has stayed constant – continuously infusing our passion for singing with our passion for sharing the gospel message. This vision has been the main driving force for the ongoing improvement in the quality of our performances.

Our activities include regular performances at a variety of events such as: Supperclub (a dinner held for homeless people), Ideal homeshow, at churches, and at events put on by Imperial societies. We host our annual Christmas and Easter concerts with our Easter concert coming up on the 14th of March, (6:30p.m. at St Alban’s, Fulham, W6 8H)

The details for UGCY are: 18th March, 6:30pm, The Hippodrome, North End Road, Golders Green NW11 7RP.
