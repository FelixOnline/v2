  they’ve become necessary

Let’s get this straight: Antifa is not some group of recently post-pubescent students with an inherent hatred of bronze figures. Antifa action is, in principle, taken up to fight against violence or intolerance by fascists (a.k.a. racist/ nationalist scumbags).  Whilst I’ll applaud Baltimore’s mayor Catherine Pugh for promptly removing all the confederate statues from the city in response to the Unite the Right rally, that saw a woman lose her life to a white-supremacist with road rage, the reality is that the rest of the country has not caught on. Protections are already widespread and growing (with dull names like the “Alabama Memorial Preservation Act”) for monuments that glorify those who rejected the right of slaves to be treated like human beings.  No wonder that some people have decided to take matters into their own hands, since the democratic governments that should be taking them down have gone in the complete opposite direction.  Let’s acknowledge that these are not just statues that objectively inform us of our checkered past, but monuments with inscriptions like “In memory of the boys who wore gray” as a symbol of admiration for their efforts. To continue to protect these memorials that revel in false heroism is misguided if done in the name of historical preservation, since nobody is suggesting an en masse burning of confederate historical files.  The fact that the KKK and Nazi sympathisers have taken to prancing around statues whilst threatening global genocide shows the level of bizarreness we have reached 70 years after laws were put in place to prevent just this sort of thing.  Now, a word of caution: even though Antifa in the US is much more of a movement than a general idea, as it is over here in the old world (with the original German antifascists just dressing up in black to bash in some nazi skulls), it’s still not right to think of Antifa as one group. They certainly don’t have a leader akin to a prime minister or a CEO. Nobody’s making decisions that everyone has to follow blindly, and I guarantee you anyone who tried wouldn’t last very long. You’ll have a much better time understanding how this works when you understand that Antifa is an idea – the principle – that sometimes the best way to deal with white supremacists, the KKK, and neo-Nazis is to actually get up out of our armchairs, go beyond checking a box on a piece of paper every five years, and physically stop them.  The law might not allow for it, but laws that have failed to stop a new wave of fascism are laws that have failed.
