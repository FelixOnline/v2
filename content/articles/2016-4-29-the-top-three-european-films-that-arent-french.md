As much as I love the more abstract/pretentious cinema offerings at any one time, I can’t bloody stand French films. I’m not saying that all French films are bad – that would be ridiculous. My argument, which I would hope is at least somewhat informed, is that the French ‘style’ of filmmaking is just something I cannot stand: pretentious dialogue, a penchant for lengthy, static shots, and a weird fascination with narratives focusing on young women falling in love with old men. You may have started it France, but the rest of Europe is going to finish it:

_The Hunt (2012)_

Starting on a high, _The Hunt_ is a Danish film focusing on _Hannibal_ star Mads Mikkelsen who, when falsely accused of molesting a young girl at his primary school, is made an outcast and a villain in his local community. It is far from the cheeriest film in the world, but the sympathy it elicits and the flawless performances of the deeply complex characters set it apart as a masterpiece. The Scandinavians are just so bloody good at this.

_Bicycle Thieves (1948)_

_Bicycle Thieves_ is a classic Italian film most often found on the top ten lists of desperately elitist film critics. Looking past this however, it’s still rather good, and what makes the film stand out is the unique snapshot it gives us of post-war Italy. The rather simple story here simply serves, to me, as an excuse to lose yourself in the buzzing atmosphere of Italy just after WWII.

_Chico and Rita (2010)_

_Chico and Rita_ is a vibrant and exciting Spanish/English animated feature showcasing the brilliant world of 1940s Cuban jazz. From its unique and gorgeous art style, to its music and settings, _Chico and Rita_ is absolutely captivating – gorgeous from start to finish.
