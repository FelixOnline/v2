In a speech made to the 2011 Google Zeitgeist conference, Chancellor George Osborne announced that Imperial, in collaboration with UCL, are developing plans for a new Research and Innovation Centre in Shoreditch. The project is part of the Government’s ‘Tech City’ initiative that aims to create a new Silicon Valley in East London.

The Research Centre will focus on how data from ‘smart infrastructure’ – a combination of the internet, mobile communications, embedded sensor technology and information analytics – could transform cities of the future. An example of a potential area of research could be the creation of a personal CO2 market through the real-time monitoring of individual CO2 emissions.

A spokesperson for Imperial said, “Academic research will be placed at the heart of the Centre […] Key scientific areas for exploration include novel sensor technologies, the scaling of communications and network technologies, spatial and geographical analysis methods, interaction design and behavioural analysis, and visualisation technologies. […] Both UCL and Imperial jointly possess expertise that spans both scientific research and the ability to contribute to service and business model innovation. The partnership between innovative companies and universities is essential, where research is shaped by business and user requirements and where scientific advance contributes to business success”

Felix has been told that a 5-year pilot phase is currently being developed, involving corporate partnerships and joint private/public funding.
