S

tudents from all faculties flocked to the RCSU Science Challenge Launch on Monday evening to meet this year’s star judges and hear how they could get their hands on the £4000 prize pot.

The informal event kicked off with demonstrations from the physics outreach team before Saima Seer, this years Science Challenge Chair, introduced the judges, the questions and the prizes.

Addresses from Dr Aarathi Prasad and Dr Eric van Sebille were definitely the highlights of the Launch. Dr Prasad reflected on how nature can be a invaluable source of inspiration for scientists and science-communicators, whilst Dr Sebille made an impassioned case about the need for clear and simple arguments when communicating science to general society. The buoyant crowd of sixthformers, Imperialites and sabbs then descended for the finest of catering college could provide and to mingle with the speakers.

The Royal College of Science Union: Science Challenge is the UK’s largest student-run science communication competition and has developed a reputation for A-list judges, extravagant prizes and the annual final which is held at a swanky central-London venue. The competition is traditionally open to all students of Imperial and UK sixth formers, however this year the RCSU were delighted to announce that they are taking submissions from sixth form-aged students from around the globe! After all, scientific discovery has no borders. Entrants are required to submit a short essay (or video) in answer to the judges’ questions before the judges present the winners with their prizes at the Grand Final.

To find out more and enter please visit: sciencechallenge.org. And in the words of Raven: “Let the challenge begin”.

**Judges and Questions**

Dr. Aarathi Prasad is a writer, broadcaster and Imperial alumnus!

“Throughout human history we have taken inspiration from the natural world to invent and innovate. What would you would mimic to improve our health or capabilities? How would you do it?”

Prof. Sir Brian Hoskins is Professor of Meteorology at Reading University and Director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change.

“As uncertainty is often used as an excuse for inaction, how should scientists communicate without compromising their science?”

Prof. Sir John Pendry is a condensed matter theorist, famed for making the first ‘invisibility cloak’.

“Describe the various ways in which invisibility has been sought and briefly explain the science behind them.”
