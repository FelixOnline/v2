University College London (UCL) [this week announced their planned adoption of the American-style grade point average system](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/1503/ucl-to-introduce-grade-point-average/) in lieu of traditional degree classifications. Naturally, this raises the question as to whether UCL are leading the charge against a “crude and undistinguished” system in an attempt to improve the value of a degree, or whether they are simply hoping to ensure easier comparison with American institutions.

A prime issue with the new system that should be considered is the effect that it could potentially have on students themselves. The grade point average system, existing as an average of the numerical grades received across all exams, allows for an even greater comparison and ranking between students.

While there is truth in the sentiment that competition encourages subsequent determination, such competition may also generate additional pressure on students already striving to be the best in one of the most academically tough and rigorous institutions that the country has to offer.

The current system of degree classifications allows some room for manoeuvre in terms of students who may inadvertently perform less well than expected during an exam. Indeed, all it takes in some cases is one ‘bad exam’ for an overall average to significantly drop. Cases like this are not rare, and an encouragement of a more detailed ranking of students may heighten the tensions that the end of year inevitably brings with it.

In many cases the current classifications allow employers to see where a student roughly stands academically, without becoming entangled in comparing individual marks. A move to the new system could easily remove the meaning of interviews – to demonstrate capabilities besides academic prowess.

Grade inflation must be tackled, of course. Even so, it is not a problem wholly unique to higher education. It is instead an issue that affects all levels of education, including GCSE and A-Level. With the International Baccalaureate being adopted by an increasing selection of UK institutions as a possible counter measure, those with the power to make changes to degree systems may do well to follow such an example.

Ultimately, any radical venture towards the adoption of a new system must be carefully considered by academics and students alike – a numerical mark can never be entirely demonstrative of a student’s capabilities. It would not be a surprise should the scheme be implemented for dissatisfaction to be voiced, not only among employers who must adapt to the change in order to accommodate UCLs plan, but also among students who primarily come here to best themselves, and not prove their own ability over others.
