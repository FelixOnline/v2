London is filled with loads of cafés, which, let’s face it, look almost the same and offer very similar products. That’s why it’s completely OK to feel sick of them. There is, however, a place in London where you can have your coffee or tea like you’ve never have before. It’s small, it’s cozy, it’s friendly, it’s “Betty Blythe”. Named after the Hollywood starlet, “Betty Blythe” is a beautiful, vintage teashop and fine food pantry in west London – just 10 minutes walking from Hammersmith Station.

Betty Blythe offers a complete selection of coffees and teas, as well as a wide range of fresh pastries, muffins and cakes. The highlight of a visitor’s experience in my opinion is the macaroons. They look fresh and they taste fresh; having just the right size they match incredibly with a morning or afternoon tea without being too sweet. The counter is full with beautifully made cakes and colourful treats and the staff look very keen to help you choose!

Betty Blythe is also a wonderful spot for an elegant hen-do or a birthday party offering pretty decor and delicious food. You can choose between the main café and the downstairs tearoom – for a more private space.

Betty Blythe is the absolute vintage and glamorous get-together place for you girls to meet, chit-chat, have your party and gossip (now I’m being rude!). For you guys I have one thing to say: the food there is too good to get stopped by the girlie tone of the café. Take your girlfriend, sister or mother – although that’s just sad – and have a try; you won’t regret it!
