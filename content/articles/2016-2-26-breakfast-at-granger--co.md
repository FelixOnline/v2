Your committed relationship to Wasabi for breakfast, lunch, dinner AND midnight snack is just not working any more. You’ve tried everything at Hummingbird from cupcakes to whoopie pies, risking diabetes and an E number overload. You’ve even set foot into Roots &amp; Bulbs desperate for something new, green and wholesomely natural.

That’s it. We are leaving South Kensington.

Situated on Westbourne Grove, Notting Hill, Granger &amp; Co. will be your perfect spot to get your Aussie breakfast fix. Walk inside to find a well-lit, airy, spacious room with clean, marble tables and a casual, minimalist vibe.

But we have no time to devour the interior. Let’s get down to food.

I always order a coffee or a hot chocolate to start my meal. For some reason they always surprise me with crazy animal patterns covering the entire interior of the glass. My mocha came with a thick layer of chocolate on the sides, with furious feline claw marks. And the coffee itself? GOOD. Finally, something different from our Library Café.

Now. If you come here without trying their signature ricotta hotcakes, you are seriously missing out in life. Three 1” thick hotcakes, pan fried to a beautiful golden brown, stacked on top of a freshly peeled banana, a knob of honeycomb butter next to a mini jug of syrup. Served steaming hot on a clean white plate. Fluffy, like a marshmallow. Creamy and velvety with generous chunks of ricotta studded inside. Soaked up the syrup and melted butter like a sponge to give you that filling, comforting, buttery goodness in every mouthful.

Trust me and try it. You will never go back to Wasabi.
