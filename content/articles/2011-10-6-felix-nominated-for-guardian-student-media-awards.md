Felix has been shortlisted for Student Publication of the Year in the [Guardian Student Media Awards 2011](http://www.guardian.co.uk/student-media-awards-2011). The other finalists in this category are [Cherwell](http://www.cherwell.org/) (University of Oxford), Mouth (Kingston University), [River](http://www.riveronline.co.uk/) (Kingston University) and [York Vision](http://www.yorkvision.co.uk/) (University of York). In addition, 2 of the 5 nominations for Digital Journalist of the Year are Felix contributors: Dylan Lowe and Jake Lea-Wilson. The winners will be announced at the Awards ceremony in November.

Last year’s Felix Editor-in-Chief Kadhim Shubber expressed his delight following the announcement: “I’m really happy that we’ve been nominated. Felix has been nominated four times in the past six years, so I think we’ve got something to be proud of. I want to say thank you to everyone who contributed last year; this nomination is a recognition of their tireless efforts.
