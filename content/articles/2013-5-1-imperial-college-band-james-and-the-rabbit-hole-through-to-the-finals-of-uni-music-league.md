Uni Music League is a unique project that has hit the UK with a bang. Acting as a support system for up-and-coming student musicians and bridging the gap between the unsigned world and the professional music industry, Uni Music League is the UK’s biggest student-based music competition. The immense prize package which James and the Rabbit Hole from Imperial College are hoping to win is an EP recording deal with Metropolis Studios, the opportunity to perform at the Wilderness Festival, support slots at KOKO, full PR campaign and professional photography shoots. Yes, it really is a dream prize for any up and coming musician…

James and the Rabbit Hole consist of five members: James Burrows, Francis Clegg, Dan Day, Tim Plummer and Conor Nelson. Music has always been a huge part of all their lives from a very young age with inspirations drawn from Marvin Gaye to the Red Hot Chilli Peppers to Aretha Franklin. The result? An accomplished old-school sound with lyrics akin to countrystory telling.

Despite only being together for a short while, James and The Rabbit Hole have already achieved so much. Moulding their own version of rock and roll out of solid funk beats and a classic gritty tone, they have barrelled their way through Uni Music League in a way that only a true rock and roll band can – through roaring guitar driven tunes that have moved crowds across the capital.

In this day and age, it is rare to meet a group of young musicians with such genuine talent but James and The Rabbit Hole really do have it all. Live, they represent and capture an electric atmosphere, transporting listeners and fans to a time when guitar music represented the perfect blend of art and human interaction. Through blood on their fingers, sweat on their brows and a sound that will mesmerise and inspire, James and The Rabbit Hole are sure to stamp their mark on this city and Uni Music League. Stripping the arguably bloated genre of rock and roll to its bare bones and laying before the world the true essence of what being in a band is about; talent, dedication and the ability to infiltrate the souls and minds of those present.

_Show James and The Rabbit Hole your support by heading down to the 02 Academy, Islington on the 9th May for the Uni Music League finals. Tickets are £5 from [studentcom.co.uk](http://studentcom.co.uk)_
