Upon a day in springtime warming outside birds and bees were swarming,
 I recalled, with passion forming, sunny days of springs of yore
 Days of sunny spring enticing, days of song and dance comprising
 but, alas!, I was revising things I should have learnt before
 “Stop wasting time”, I reprimanded, “reminiscing lo’ers your score.
 Only that, and nothing more”

Settling down to solve the paper, my resolve began to taper
 My inner self became a vapour, drifting to some distant shore
 From the dreamer’s lofty station, I surveyed the whole Creation
 But I knew my concentration had been broken at its core
 My ignorance seemed overpowering, and exams were at the door
 “Why did I not read before?”

And as such the days went flying, nothing learnt and slowly dying
 Tied down by the shackles of the not-quite-studying I deplore
 Mere mortals would with great sensation gawp at my procrastination
 Witnessing the daft deflation of the knowledge I could store
 When exams were over I received the e-mail I abhore
 “Weak 2:2 and nothing more”

As I did my awful reading, I could see my life proceeding
 into joblessness and needing, what were these last four years for?
 I heartfeltedly regretted: “Now I’m heavily indebted,
 and my life is nearly wasted if I can’t improve my score”
 I would go and see my tutor, throw myself upon his floor
 It’s not much I’m asking for

Shutting down the school computer, shaking like a nervous suitor
 I went to ask my personal tutor if he could my grades restore
 Almost prostrate there before him, I heartshakingly implored him
 “I was stupid, wasting time, I know I could do so much more
 Would you let me resit this exam to get a better score?”
 Qouth the tutor “Nevermore”

I explained that I had faltered, if I could have anything altered
 I would have gone back in time and made it so I studied more
 “Everything we’ve studied, tested in two weeks, with so much vested
 is it strange that I was bested by the pressure and the chore?
 Will I ever have a job where I won’t have to sweep the floor?”
 Quoth the tutor “Nevermore”
