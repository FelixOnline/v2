Any excuse to visit one of my favourite venues in London is welcomed by me, so much more the better when that excuse is me donating to an amazing charity and getting a great, music-heavy evening in return.

The Oval Space is small and intimate, overlooking an industrial side of the city which adds to the very unique vibe that the venue offers. Alongside this is a great sound system and an outside area perfect for tearing away from the sweaty crowds for short dance-free breaks. The crowd there is always an incredible one to be part of, even more so this night when it felt as if a big community came together over their love for music, all in the good of donating to a great cause. The whole night was run for free as all proceedings went to charity, with the DJs coming in as special guests – most of them only revealed on the night.

This night was hosted as a fundraiser for Mind, a charity aimed at providing support to those suffering from mental health problems. This involves raising awareness, campaigning to improve the services available, and helping promote a better understanding of this serious set of illnesses that affect around 25% of young adults every year.

The greatness of their fundraiser doesn’t stop there though, as the music blasting through the venue when you enter the heavy double doors is eager to prove. A huge line-up with the likes of Maribou State, George Fitzgerald, and Midland led to a day-long music event with amazing beats, drops, light-shows, and overpriced cans of cider (the beer sold-out within a couple hours).

Each set flowed on from the other flawlessly, sometimes without me ever even noticing the change-over. This could be due very much to the intensity of the music and how easily you were absorbed into it, dancing along with the crowd to each track before realising that hours had passed and you were in desperate need of some fresh air.

This was a perfect example of a charity knowing its crowd and appealing to them in a way that not only offers them an amazing day of music, fun and dancing, but raises awareness of the illness to the age group most affected, and letting them help out in a way that they love.
