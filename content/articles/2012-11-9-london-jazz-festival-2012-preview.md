Tonight sees the return of the London Jazz Festival. The capital’s largest pan-city festival, this two week affair comprises hundreds of events spanning dozens of venues.

Glancing at the range of the bands playing this year reveals that the days of ‘jazz tradition’ are long gone. One would be hard-pressed to distil many common themes from the characteristics of the groups performing over the next two weeks, given the breadth of their influences, the seemingly unlikely genre fusions, and the widespread propensity to push boundaries in every conceivable direction.

With some of the more well known performers long since sold out, here are my “alternative picks” of the festival - just a few those groups who I feel are leading jazz in exciting new directions.
 Tonight (9th) sees a triple bill of up-and-coming Norwegian artists at Vortex. __Bushman’s Revenge__ whose genre bending sound has been described as “moving between jazz and classic heavy rock … with traces of blues, prog and acid rock” will be joined by Rune Grammofon label-mates __Albatrosh__, a dynamic piano/saxophone duo who effortlessly blend strong compositional and melodic nous with elements of near-telepathic free-improvisation. Rounding out the line up are __Synkoke__, self described as “punked prog-jazz”, their no-holds-barred approach is a modern take on the style pioneered by groups such as __Peter Brötzmann__’s __Last Exit__. Not for the faint of heart!

Award-winning Finnish experimentalists __Oddarang__ (Southbank Centre, 10th, free) blend their unique strain of jazz with influences from world music, classical, and post-rock to create moving, minimalist soundscapes set against a gently propulsive rhythm section and ethereal melodies, whose overarching aesthetic has been likened to the works of Icelandic group __Sigur Rós__.

One-man band __Hyperpotamus__ (11th, Artsdepot, free) produces music using only his voice and a loop pedal, both singing and using wordless vocalisation to provide rhythmic and melodic lines, and creating technically impressive multi-layered compositions.

The talented, young, London five-piece __Psylus__ (13th, Southbank Centre, free) melds contemporary bop-ish themes and free improvisation with elements of hip-hop and electronica, to create a refreshingly creative sound that is poised to become a success on the international jazz scene.

London’s __World Service Project__ (16th, Vortex) use their tight, groovy rhythm section as a basis for trumpet and sax to lock horns in lively conversation over liquid time-changes and a danceable funk-laden beat. Supporting them are Norwegian indie-jazz ensemble __Pixel__, who combine the energy of indie rock with the structural and harmonic freedoms of jazz. Leeds’ __Roller Trio__, complete the night’s line up, a group combining elements of funk, noise, electronic, and rock music with schizophrenic themes but whose identity ultimately eludes pigeonholing given the immense variety in their compositions.

Underground legends of Poland’s new jazz scene, __Jazzpospolita__ (16th, POSK) mix jazz with elements of psychedelic rock and electronic music to create delightfully modern yet accessible sound.

On the back of this year’s stunning debut on Tzadik’s _Spotlight Series_, French jazzers __Guillaume Perret & The Electric Epic__ are set to storm the Bishopsgate Institute on the 17th with their breed of highly energetic fusion of electric jazz and progressive rock. The triple bill also includes the Leeds based __trioVD__, fearlessly shattering conventions with a metallic, abrasive mixture of distorted guitars, thrashing drums, and wailing sax, all whilst retaining a strong sense of direction and melodic sensibility. Norwegian trio __Puma__ will push levels into the red with their noisy, electric, free-rock-inspired improvisations that show excellent dynamic range and variety.

The long running Norwegian electric improvisational group __Supersilent__ will play out the festival (18th, Village Underground) in collaboration with __Led Zeppelin__ bassist John Paul Jones. Given that Supersilent’s only rule is “no rehearsals”, expect the unexpected from this consistently creative collective as they explore hitherto uncharted soundscapes.

_The festival runs from Friday November 9th – Sunday November 18th. See [www.londonjazzfestival.org.uk](http://www.londonjazzfestival.org.uk) for more details including a full event listing._
