Ding Dong, the witch is dead, but not for these students in Canterbury, who want a 70m tall idol of their idol built outside their union’s Metric equivalent.

The campaign is in its second stage, which involves collecting signatures, having already been approved by their union.

The petition, which currently has 88 signatures, has ten more days to get the 150 it needs to proceed to the next level of consideration.

The Conservative Society’s chair says although it started off as a way to highlight flaws in the union’s petitioning system, they are now “going to run with it”.

This is not the first time Kent University’s Conservative Society has campaigned for a statue of Thatcher.  Two years ago, just after her death, a committee member called for a marble statue of her likeness to be built by the union. Unsupringly, he was downvoted to oblivion.

Thatcher, who was the first female Prime Minister and in office throughout the entirity of the 1980s,  was a fierce campaigner against unions, once calling unionised striking miners, “the enemy within”.
