Did you know?

Mr Clark is an ardent supporter of homeopathic treatments and has a homeopathic hospital in his constituency.

Mr Willetts is a tough act to follow. Critics are unconvinced as to whether Mr Clark will be able to secure the funding necessary for Universities, but it is thought his links with Chancellor George Osborne will stand him in good stead.
