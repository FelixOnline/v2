 - This is not news  a pub space was always in the plan I think the felix has missed the argument of the postgraduate and staff that the plans significantly reduce the space available to the holland club  Most of the space is assigned to a new commoncatering facility for the postgraduates  which is not asked for by the postgraduates nor is it wanted Keep the Holland club to its original layout and invest in the decor and the overall cost will be probably be 110th of the millions planned Is this another example of capital projects making up work for themselves library entrance

Following a meeting of the Management Board on 20 April, an agreement has been reached over the proposed development of the space currently occupied by the Holland Club on Level 0 of Sherfield.

The space will continue to provide a “pub facility”, which will be open to staff, postgraduate research and postgraduate taught students, along with a catering facility.

Consideration will be given as to whether undergraduates will have access to the catering facility.

An additional ‘social space’ will be accessible throughout the day and over weekends.

An advisory Group consisting of the Senior Dean, representatives from Imperial College Union, the Holland Club, and Commercial Services has been formed and will work on the next stage of the design process. Designs and costings will be submitted to the College’s Portfolio Review Board in June or July for approval before any further progress is made.
