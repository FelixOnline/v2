The truth is that organic products have managed to attract a large number of people in the United Kingdom. In addition, the increase in the number of people buying organic goods is showing no signs of slowing down. The supporters of this ‘green lifestyle’ believe that it is not just a fashion trend that is going to disappear in the future, as they argue that organic products are of greater quality despite their slightly higher cost.

The producers explain that the reason for the popularity of organic food is because they are free from hormones, pesticides, preservatives, and chemicals – offering healthier nutrition to the consumers.
 And this is scientifically confirmed.

Research that took place in the USA in 1984 proved that organic products contain many more nutrients like phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and potassium. Specifically, organic lettuce contains almost twice as much phosphorus and four times the quantity of calcium that is contained in the conventional lettuce.

Moreover, a group of European scientists have proved that organic fruit and vegetables contain 40% more antioxidants than normal. Antioxidants are beneficial for the heart and help the prevention of cancer.

In addition to the health benefits, the organic production systems have a large ecosystem impact, as they are designed to respect the balance observed in our natural ecosystems. Organic farms actively encourage biodiversity in order to maintain soil fertility and aid natural pest control – in contrast with conventional farms.

Therefore, after a great deal of research in organic markets and farms, I have prepared a shopping list for you listing my top five organic products available on the market, so that you know where to go and what to choose!
