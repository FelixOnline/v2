The majority of students at this university, one would hope, have a good idea of why they are studying their particular subject and why they are at Imperial. To cut straight to the point, it is commonly a combination of the reputation and quality of an Imperial degree, the concentration of world-class and cutting-edge research and of course, that rejection letter from Oxford or Cambridge. We jest, we jest. Put more simply, it is usually either because we want a high paying job, in finance or industry, or because we wish to embark on an academic career.

But, while those things are what give our time at Imperial drive and purpose – one would hardly pull all-nighters every few months without expecting some significant reward at the end – it is the social experience that gives us joy and happiness. We do not accept that the social life at Imperial is uniquely deficient. Quite the opposite, there's a great vibrant social experience to be had at this university and much of it is powered by our wonderful Clubs & Societies.

And what a range and quality of Clubs & Societies we are blessed with. Without naming any individually – for fear of causing offense by omission – the student organisations excel themselves each and every week. From the sporting achievements of our athletes to events that professionals couldn't hope to surpass, our students consistently show their worth and their passion for the world beyond their studies.

But why is this important? Aside from the substantial amount of money that we raise for charities, the extra-curricular activities make Imperial, to be blunt, a bearable place to study. The large workload and difficult subject matter can, at times, feel like an unbearable burden. It is extremely important that we are able to escape our subjects for a while and explore other disciplines. Which, for the record, is not something that students at other universities are able to do to the extent that we are – our Clubs & Societies are amongst the most successful, numerous and varied in the UK.

When we have completed our degrees, whether we have embarked on careers in the City, entered into research or some other path, we shall surely acknowledge that the Imperial academic brand has carried us forward with some advantage. But when we look back on our time here, we suspect that it will be those extra-curricular achievements of which we are most proud. Thatís why we raise our glasses, so to speak, to those creative, energetic and enthusiastic students who make our time at Imperial truly memorable and above all, fun. Thank you all.
