The results for this year’s Union ‘Big Elections’ were announced over a staggered period this year . The elections, which saw a record turnout of 41.09% of students, also saw a technical issue that and disagreements between candidates over campaigning that ultimately led to a delay of the declaration of results.

After voting began on 12 March, and as previously reported, the online voting system failed to display Deputy President (Welfare) candidate Jack Hewitt’s manifesto on the “in-line” view. Hewitt claimed that this was a “massive disadvantage”, with 11.5% of the total votes being potentially affected by the error. While the Elections Committee originally ruled that all affected votes be struck, this decision was appealed and taken to Union Court, where the decision was quashed and declared unconstitutional.

The Presidential campaign was also affected by delays as individual candidates brought forward complaints against tactics used during the campaign.

The results for Deputy President (Welfare) and President were delayed until 22 March and 27 March respectively rather than the 20 March for the other positions.
