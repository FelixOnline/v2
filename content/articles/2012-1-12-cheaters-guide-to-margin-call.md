What is shown in Margin Call is what really might have happened in the final days leading up to the eventual financial collapse of 2008 that has put the global market in chaos.

Set in an unnamed but very successful investment firm, as the company’s CEO (the brilliantly sly Irons) learns of his troubled investments that can take down his empire in one clean swoop, he makes the corrupt decision to sell off all of the company’s toxic assets, before anyone can close in on his downfall.

In short, he decreases his company’s exposure in what will become the biggest financial crisis in history, whilst taking down the rest of the world’s economy along with him.

A lot of financial talk shouldn’t put you off from watching this gripping Wall Street drama, as the talented actors turn heavy dialogue into compelling, dramatic exchange.

More surprising however, is how Chandor, in his compelling directorial debut, remembers to neither condone nor condemn his characters. It’s easy to have a condescending, angry tone against the investment bankers selling away their designated share of worthless holdings, but Chandor’s subtle direction opts to examine the many employees involved in this chaotic mess on a more personal level.

All the characters, no matter what positions they hold, are shown to have vulnerabilities and insecurities of their own, even in very brief moments, and their personal struggles coping with the demise of the world economy is a fresh, fair-minded and honest approach in the midst of so much hate and anger displayed towards bankers nowadays.
