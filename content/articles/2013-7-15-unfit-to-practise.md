Dr. Thilanga Iddamalgoda, a former Clinical Research Fellow at Imperial was arrested in August of last year in Trafalgar Square after plain clothed police officer PC Tiffany Anderson noitced his suspicious behaviour. Upon further examination it was discovered that Dr. Iddamalgoda, a former Senior House Officer in Cardiothoracic Surgery had been secretly filming up women's skirts in Trafalgar Square, taking videos of women's thigh, chest and groin regions on his iPhone. One of these videos included footage of the legs of the arresting officer, who was horrified to find the video of herself on his phone. Following his arrest Dr. Iddamalgoda accepted a caution at Charing Cross Police Station for outraging public decency.

In an interview with the Daily Mail the arresting officer PC Tiffany Anderson described how the doctor kept shieding his screen from view and pointing his phone at different women. After seeing his phone on camera mode from her seat behind him she and her fellow officers approached the doctor when he moved away. According to PC Anderson upon confrontation Dr. Iddamalgoda appeared very embarrassed and pleaded not to be arrested, claiming it was his "first time".

Following a Fitness to Practice hearing in Manchester at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service on June 8-9th 2013, Dr. Iddamalgoda had his registration suspended for 12 months. According to a spokesperson for the MPTS, "The offence was serious in nature and his conduct was sexually motivated. Such behaviour is unbefitting of a doctor... The Panel has determined that a period of 12 months' suspension is the most appropriate sanction in this case".
