Eton seemed like a fitting venue for Imperial’s first official Eton fives tournament as a society.

Sixty eight players competing in pairs from seventeen different universities descending on the birthplace of the sport to prove they have the best teamwork, coordination and skill in the academic world.

Best described as squash with your hands, Eton fives has only three walls and a multitude of ledges modelled on the alcove of Eton school where it was first invented. The ledges made the game unpredictable, coining the phrase “a game of hazards”.

The universities tournament is traditionally dominated by Oxford and Cambridge who, with their own courts in numerous colleges made a third of the turnout. This year, however, the London teams, spearheaded by Imperial’s Tommy Fagen brought the pain, losing only to the Cambridge first pair in the pools.

Meanwhile the London second team with our very own Raju Patel beat Oxford’s fourth pair with a dominating score (12-2) in their first game but narrowly lost the top two slots that would have seen them through. Their fortunes changed in the plate and they beat their two Cambridge rivals to see them take third place. Tommy Fagen and partner passed through the quarter finals without incident but in a cruel twist of fate found themselves against the same Cambridge first pair that kept them from the top spot in the pools.

After a long couple of games the pair found themselves out of the competition. Congratulations to the pair who achieved a top 4 position out of the 34 pair turnout. In the girls competition we are proud of the London first pair who beat Oxford in the finals; the first time Oxbridge hasn’t taken the prize.

Fives is an extremely fast growing sport, only now breaking out of the secondary school mould; we have just formed a Fives society to catering from all forms of fives and one wall handball.

If you want to try this unique, friendly and social sport, contact the fives society at fivesclub@imperial.ac.uk which allowing you to be placed our mailing lists so you can be kept up to date with upcoming events. There will also be a free introductory session for all novice fives players on the 8th of December.
