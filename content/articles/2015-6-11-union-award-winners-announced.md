Imperial College Union Council ratified the list of individual Union Award winners at its meeting on Tuesday 8 June, which sees 156 students out of the 310 who were nominated receiving various accolades. The awards recognise those working across the Union, from clubs and societies to representation, with a belief that ‘those who have gone over and above what is expected of them should be recognised.’

Selection of Union Award winners was conducted by the Union Awards Committee, consisting of three Officer Trustees and nine appointed Union members with a longstanding history of senior contribution to Union life and activities.

Council was only asked to uphold the list of winners for Union Colours, Outstanding Services Awards and Union Fellowships. Other award winners, such as Community Connections Volunteer of the Year, Club, Society & Project of the Year and the President’s Awards, will only be announced at the Union Awards ceremony on Monday 15 June.
