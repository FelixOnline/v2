Wednesday 25th saw Obama give his second State of the Union address – his first since his party’s ‘shellacking’ at the hands of the Republicans in November’s mid term elections. The speech was short on policy but included concessions to the Republicans. His speech included:

– The rocketing advance of China and India, and the need to confront this as the US did when faced with the technological advance of the USSR – the need to find this generation’s “sputnik moment”.

– The promise of increased spending in scientific research; especially in clean energy.

– A 5 year spending freeze to save $400 billion.

– Lower corporate tax and simpler regulations.

– Tougher sanctions on Iran and reiterated support for South Korea.

– Support for the ousting of Tunisia’s president and ‘the democratic aspirations of all people’.
