Spiegel Saloon returns to Central London as part of Hyde Park’s Winter Wonderland. Open until Tuesday 3rd January, the stunning bar and restaurant is the only fully heated place within Winter Wonderland. Going back to the early 19th century, Spiegel Tents were travelling ballrooms and entertainment salons, originating in Belgium. Spiegel Saloon maintains this charming aura of tradition; the bar is spacious – the saloon seats up to 200 visitors – and the comfy sofas and beanbags contribute to a warm welcoming.

If you’re up for just a quick drink or seeking a place to dine, Spiegel Saloon is the perfect place in Winter Wonderland. Choice in drinks is wide; Spiced Hot Farmhouse Cider, Hot Toddy, and Mulled Wine are all great, especially if winter flu has knocked on your door and coursework deadlines are all over the place. Foodwise, Spiegel Saloon offers a Prix Fixe menu, with two courses for £14.95 and three courses on offer for £19.45. The selection ranges from seasonal dishes, such as The Spiegel Christmas Plate to firm favourites such as Bangers and Mash. The food will not be the best you’ve ever had, but looking at the price together with the Christmassy atmosphere, it is the best for those who need refuelling after a fun time on the Winter Wonderland rides. Desserts are nothing less than fulfilling; my suggestion would be the Chocolate Soup Platter for two, a warm bowl of melted chocolate served with marshmallows, strawberries, profiteroles, and waffles – the perfect chocolate experience for the cold nights to come.

Finally, what would a saloon be without live music and entertainment? Certainly, it wouldn’t be a saloon at all. Here, live entertainment is essential, daily and, above all, free!
