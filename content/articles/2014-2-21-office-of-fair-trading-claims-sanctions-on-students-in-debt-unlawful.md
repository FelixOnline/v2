After analysing the terms and conditions of over 100 UK Higher Education Institutions, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) concluded that almost 75% included sections that could stop students graduating or progressing to the next year of study if they were in debt to their institution.

The OFT stated that “the blanket use of academic sanctions in such instances, regardless of the circumstances, could breach consumer protection law”.

The circumstances in which students can be sanctioned include owing fines for late library books or childcare services and non-academic debt.

A paper submitted to the Union’s Executive Committee last August revealed that no student at Imperial has been prevented from graduating of progressing because of outstanding academic charges.
