In the latest fundraising endeavour, open to both Raincatcher members and members of the public, each person will carry 10 litres of water approximately 10 miles from Tower Bridge to Imperial College. The Water Carry Walk is taking place this Saturday (10 March) so it’s not too late to join in, but do get a move on! As well as being a way to collect sponsorship for our project over the summer of building a rainwater harvesting system, this event helps to highlight the importance of a sustainable water supply.

Each day in Tanzania, hundreds of children as young as 5 have to carry clean drinking water similar distances from government-owned and distributed supplies back to their homes. We’re trying to bring this to public attention by showing what a physical feat this is to carry water long distances. Given that this walk has earned Raincatcher a lot of publicity and donations in the past, we hope this year’s will be a success too!

As mentioned, you don’t have to be part of Raincatcher to participate. So if you want to come along and help out our charity, experience what hundreds of children have to do, or if you just want to show off your muscles, come along and join in! For every participant raising over £100, we will provide a free Raincatcher T-shirt!

So what are you waiting for? Get involved! Sponsorship forms are available from our website: [www.raincatcherimperial.org](http://www.raincatcherimperial.org). You can also find out details about our project and donate to us through Virgin Money Giving on the site!
