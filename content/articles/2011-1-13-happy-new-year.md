As another year begins again and starts us off right at the beginning of Oscar season, the Felix Film writers take a look back at the best of cinema in 2010 – in case you were in some kind of year-long coma – and discuss some of our most anticipated films of 2011.

There are three clear frontrunners for the top films in 2010 that spring to mind, and probably fall into most Best Of 2010 lists without question. As the first big budget movie to treat its audience like intelligent members of society, Inception fully delivered on its incredible hype, storming the box office with its stylish, mind-boggling, high-concept action and sealing Christopher Nolan’s reputation as one of the great directors of his generation.

Another film that somehow managed to meet – even exceed – expectations, was Toy Story 3, which rounded off possibly the best trilogy since The Godfather with a wonderful narrative and family fun film that set both critics and movie-goers worldwide going wild. Rounding off an excellent year, Aaron Sorkin’s impeccably scripted The Social Network has helped fuel the debate about why 26 year old billionaires – in this case, brilliantly portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg – have to be rude, often malicious people. Its razor-sharp, ultra-witty writing makes it a very likely candidate for the Best Original Screenplay gong, though this may yet be snatched away from Sorkin by this year’s early films such as The King’s Speech.

This year is full of exciting films, and we’re not just talking about the final installment in the Harry Potter franchise that could easily prove to be the most profitable film of the year. Among the most publicised films, we have a lot to look forwards to with Cowboys vs Aliens – watch the trailer now; Tintin – with the versatile Andy Serkis as Captain Haddock; and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy – how can you resist another Colin Firth film this year? Undoubtedly, however, one of the most keenly anticipated films are Danny Boyle’s 127 Hours, which is out now starring James Franco – a name we will be hearing a lot this year; and another from The Wrestler director Darren Aronofsky, Black Swan, which takes a dark dive into the mysterious world of ballet starring Nathalie Portman and Mila Kunis (inset). With the Oscars just weeks away, it’s time to catch the best of the film season whilst you can, and start placing your bets.
