If you go down to the woods tonight you’ll be in for a surprise, as there will be a teddy bear’s picnic. Alternatively, if you go to the [Blyth Gallery](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/arts/visualart/blythgallery) (fifth floor of Sherfield) you will find another surprise. It’s a shocking day for you, isn’t it.

[Twisted](http://www2.imperial.ac.uk/blog/reporter/2012/02/22/students-showcase-their-creativity-in-artsfest-2012/) is a collaborative effort between [LeoSoc](http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/arts/leonardo/) and [PhotoSoc](http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/media/photosoc/). It consists of multiple pieces of string forming a maze. This represents the mind, and walking through it is a journey through the disorder of thoughts, or at least that’s what I got from it. Moving down the corridor had the aim of feeling claustrophobic; immersed in the overbearing activity of the mind. Unfortunately for me, due to the fact that my stature is roughly that of Tom Cruise, it wasn’t quite as claustrophobic for me.

The creative process was very much organic. The concept was conceived and developed at house parties. Luckily, everyone remembered what happened and what was decided on, so the project could go ahead.

The final finished article really is impressive. The straight pieces of string form a corridor with curves that don’t seem possible. When looking at it from the inside, the way the string bunches together is very reminiscient of scientific, textbook, diagrams of neurones. It will be there until Monday, so make sure you go and check it out.
