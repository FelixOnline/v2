On All Hallows Eve the Ladies 1â€™s set out to play some oldrivals UCL. UCL definitely had a point to prove as we had put them out of 2 cups last year. We went out hard in the first 10mins with a new line-up having fresher Bryony in central-midfield controlling the game. With some good play down the right, from Gigi and Hazman we scored our first goal from a short corner, from banana slit (Harriet).

Our confidence grew and great play up to the forwards from fresher Hayley ensured we had the majority of possession. We had lots of shots narrowly missing or being saved from Jules and Sorcha. Unfortunately UCL were relentless in their determination and managed to aggressively score a goal just before half time, making the score 1-1.

We set out for the second half determined to get a goal back in the first 5 minutes. Our second goal took some time but came from a reverse stick shot again from the one and only Hazman! We were however also faced by the fearsome attack from UCL keeping our keeper Percy busy, luckily UCL were unsuccessful in getting past her ninja-like skills. She was aided by a miraculous save off the line from Emma, resulting in a breakaway from us and Hazman tucking away her hatrick. Defenders Kirsty, Maria and Anna Tommy kept strong and prevented further chances from the UCL forwards with some textbook defending, low flat tackles. The distribution from the back was beautiful from Celia helping to keep the ball down out end of the pitch and giving the forwards more and more chances. The accuracy from her passes was ultimately too much for the UCL defender to cope with and a ball through to Sorcha giving her a one-on-one chance at the goalie brought us our 4th goal of the game. Skilful tackling from Kathryn in the last few minutes of the game in our attacking D, resulted in some close chances but the final score was 4-1.

This has been a tricky season for the Ladies 1s getting promoted from last year and now facing tough teams. The team is growing in confidence and with this firstWin hopefully they can build on their successes, to try and remain in this league next season. Good Luck girls!
