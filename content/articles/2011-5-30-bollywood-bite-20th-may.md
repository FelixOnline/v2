     I agree with you - the trailers are not that amazing and actually rather disappointing. But keeping in mind that the film is to release much later these were just tasters of what is to come (latest trailer that released on Wed is actually much better). <br> <br>I'm actually glad they arent like the Endhiran because that film was so silly lol. It has a much more serious tone to it probably because superhero flicks these days tend to have a dark aura about them (cf. Dark Knight, transformation of Harry Potter films, Bond). <br> <br>With regards to the buzz, I think its quite obvious if you're living in India why its creating so much hype. Firstly, SRK always creates a hype. Secondly, sci-fi has not been tapped into Bollywood so its a new experience, the special effects are drawing people in and as always in India, if some people are bigging something up then some people will do anything to drag it back down which just ends up creating more buzz about how succesful the movie will become. <br> <br>Thanks yaar :),So basically your

__GupShup (Chit Chat) Corner__

The [RA.One](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1562871/) trailers have been creating a buzz ever since they were released at the end of March. This superhero flick starring the biggest movie star the world has ever seen, Shah Rukh Khan, is the most expensive in Indian history and is being predicted as a blockbuster to replace all others. With the Spiderman team in charge of the visual effects, Hans Zimmer (Gladiator, Inception) providing the background score and Akon lending his voice to a song, RA.One will undoubtedly grab the attention of a larger international market come 26th October.

The third instalment of the [Dhoom series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhoom_series) has been finalised to star Aamir Khan. With a new director at the helm (Vijay Acharya) this eagerly anticipated film is set to release Christmas 2012.

Confirmed! Yash Chopra’s keenly awaited returning venture (after Veer-Zaara, 2004) to the silver screen will star his favourite King Khan alongside two leading ladies yet to be cast. And none other than the great A.R.Rahman will be composing the music for what will undoubtedly be another mesmerising love story.
