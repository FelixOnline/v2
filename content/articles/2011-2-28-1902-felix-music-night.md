This one goes out to all the cool cats and saucy mamas who turned up for the first ever Felix Music Night on Saturday 19th February. I hope all 250 people who were there that night had a great time, and from the looks on people’s faces as they left Metric when the event was over, I believe it was a great success.

When I started getting in touch with acts to play this night a few months ago, I only half-believed there would be an audience for a low-budget, high-quality student night with live bands and proper music. Even up until the day of the event I was still uncertain about the turnout.

We made ticket prices low and our aim was to simply cover our costs and provide the best show possible with the resources at our disposal.

In the end we actually made a profit, which is always nice, but that is not what I will retain from 19.02.

What I will forever remember are the vibes. The vibes, man! I don’t think I remember ever attending a night out where the entire room was just full of chill, laid-back people, all enjoying themselves and the music, whilst indulging in some good old fashioned, clean, communal fun.

Not that the room was full of teetotalers. Far from that, actually, as the Union bar staff can testify. But rather than the focus being on getting trashed and dancing to cheesy tunes, everyone present at 19.02 – regardless of allegiances to IC societies, or lack thereof – was gathered by a love of live music.

I want to thank every single one of you who participated in providing the fabulous bands and DJs we had with a receptive and enthusiastic audience.

I want to thank all of the bands who played for nothing (apart from that one beer) just because they love to perform. You were all fantastic and rocked the hell out of Metric.

Thanks to Jazz n’ Rock and Music Tech for your technical support, dedication and close collaboration.

We hope to organise more Felix Music Nights in the future, and after the success of 19.02 we are now focussing on putting on an even bigger, better and crazier night than the last. Regardless of your musical taste I eagerly urge you all to come down for the next one. We’re hoping to organise some exiciting collaborations and unique surprises which I am sure you will enjoy.
