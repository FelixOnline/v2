     Next time ask me before you completely change the title and adding side notes of your preference that are offensive towards me!!!! ,Oti je na ginei eimaste dipla s!

As far as I am aware, the goal of the society is to work towards gender equality at Imperial (not female supremacy or anything like that) and men are as welcome to join and take part

I‘ve come to Imperial and my sex life sucks! What should I do?” Shut up and relax!, that’s what!”That’s what everyone should do when problems like this arise. You see, people, we all want to drive a nice car but yet sometimes we are stuck with a bicycle. What do you do then? Start crying because you’re riding a bike? No, keep working so you can buy a car and who knows, maybe on the way you will find that you do not even want a nice car.

No, guys, that is not necessarily a metaphor and this article is not necessarily about your sex life. I am just highlighting most people’s common problem with Imperial in the hope that you read what I have to say. This article intends not to solve your problem (if such a problem exists), but to reduce its dramatic effects. This article is the psychologist of all who read it – including I who wrote it. So sit back on your chair, lie down on your bed – whatever – just enjoy, relax, and continue reading.

Firstly I am going to describe the veritable domino chain of situations that filled me with the inspiration to write this. I have always believed that everyone can create something marvelous, just by exploiting those little moments of inspiration that occur throughout our lives. An inspirational moment is a moment of extreme sentimental charge which enforces the person who is involved to storm out. The trick is to direct this outflow of feelings to create something. So there I was that Friday night sitting alone in my living room with dim lights, low volume background music, smoking shisha with a sweet flavor of

> I am sad because I got rejected by that woman at the bar

watermelon and enjoying my hot chocolate accompanied by plenty of smoke. My plans of going out for drinks with my peers where abandoned. You see, I was kind of dumped by my friends who were either out with their girlfriends or just not there for some reason. It was one of those nights that one could either start complaining in one’s mind about loneliness, or simply enjoy it. I therefore took my laptop and NO, I did not visit those websites, Isimply started writing.

At this point you might actually be wondering, where am I going with this? Sometimes it can be hard to spot the obvious. A bad situation may not always be a truly bad situation; a problem may not always be a problem. The easiest way to discover this is just to look around. I catch myself being sad because I missed the bus, I am sad because I did not get a good mark in a project I was assigned, I am sad because my team lost at football, I am sad because I got rejected by that woman at the bar, I was sad because I did not go out that Friday night. WHAT? We live in London, in the belief that it is an enormous city but if we actually take a look at Google Maps (not Apple Maps!) we would discover that London is just a tiny spot on that planet called Earth. My point is that although we think that we have problems, there are much worse, much more real problems out there in this world.

I do not intend however to make you forget your problems. Otherwise the tiniest problems continue to exist as problems, though they cannot be tackled by sitting on a couch and crying. My suggestion is that we could actually do something and the first thing is just to stop complaining. I can say, with no controversy, that Imperial students complain a lot, and this is just reflected in the student satisfaction as well. The most interesting problem I have spotted here at Imperial is actually a pair of problems. Getting back on the title, guys are concerned about the ‘’lack of females’’ (which directly effects their sex life), while mostly girls are complaining about sexism. Dudes! Wake up! For the ‘’lack of females’’ issue, when a hunter finds no rabbits, he just hunts elsewhere, or he even settles with ducks, not being sure whether the rabbit or the duck is mostly appreciated. And about the sexism thing – it should be tackled immediately when it occurs but it also should not turn the other way. Why attempting to create a feminist society to tackle sexism (isn’t that sexism itself?) instead of a unisex anti-sexism society? Returning to my initial point, the solution to any problem is not continuous ‘’crying’’ and frivolous thinking but effective actions accompanied with peace of mind.

After all those paragraphs, some of you might think that we went a little bit off-track. The psychologist (the article itself) suggests that we did not. We just went through some relieving mechanisms for what could be considered a problem. Hopefully until now you may start going back and forth, remembering your troubles boosting your confidence with courage to overcome them. On the other hand, you may say ‘’gimme a break, you Hank Moody wannabe’’. The point being though, that satisfaction is a trophy to be won, not a given present by any means. The truth is that it was 3:34 AM when I was writing this, so I had to go to bed with this being done. Hence, after reading this, you either wasted your time, or you are actually facing your problems (if any) from a better angle. Goodnight.
