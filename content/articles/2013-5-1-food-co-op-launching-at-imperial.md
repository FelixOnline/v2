Imperial’s first food co-operative is starting next week! If you are looking for affordable food that benefits the producers and the planet then look no further! The aim of the co-op is to provide the Imperial College community with a one-stop shop for ethically sourced goods. We all know, and particularly during exam times, that eating well can be difficult; even Sainsbury’s on Cromwell Road seems like a trek to another land. We aim to give you a more ethical, and more convenient alternative. Our goods, sourced through a co-operative supplier, are all Fairtrade, grown in Britain or organic (if not a combination of all three)!

If you think all of this ethical goodness comes at a premium, think again. The beauty of the co-op model is that we don’t make a profit; we keep prices low for you. We sell goods at cost price, which makes our prices similar to regular supermarket lines (but our products are much better for the environment and the people who have produced the food).

Our ordering system is regular and flexible, so you can order specific products directly from us, including: wholefoods, gluten free foods and products that cater for vegetarians and vegans.

Our launch event is on Thursday 9th May in the Sherfield Foyer all day long, so come and see the range of products we have! The community sets to benefit from this scheme, so please do get involved if you want to help make positive change to our shopping and eating habits. [Join our Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/135246416662437/139239209596491/?notif_t=like), and promote the co-op to your friends! If you’re interested in volunteering with us then please do email [coop@imperial.ac.uk](mailto:coop@imperial.ac.uk).
