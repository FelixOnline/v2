 - I think internship are a valuable experience and it is up to you whether you are ripped off I graduated from in 2011 with a first and no clue which career path I wanted to take I have completed three different internship the first in PR then for a VC and the last for social media I was unpaid for all of them but made sure that there were strict terms ie I would only work for free for max of 3 months travel and food had to be covered I learned loads and would not have changed them for anything If only I had done them as part of my degree I could have saved a year of being unpaid Job aggregators like this one httpwwwadzunacoukjobsinternship are excellent for finding internships Highly recommended

As this year’s cohort of new graduates [eases itself away from university life](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/1554/largest-ever-graduation/), many will either be beginning or continuing in their new careers. However, it is important to realise that unemployment remains an ever present issue for graduates. Unemployment finds itself at its highest total since 1994, with just over two and a half million people finding themselves out of work – a significant proportion being newly graduated students. Despite these solemn figures, it is good to take a step back and realise that Imperial degrees remain highly sought after, and that we must not lose focus on what this university has to offer other than study.

The university experience has become internship-focused as of late, with undergraduates – from first year onwards – relentlessly applying for summer placements. The tenacity and drive of said students towards securing a career must be admired, but at what cost does it come? There are those who can balance the hunt for a suitable internship alongside academic work, social and sporting activities. However, there are also those who will struggle with the balance that such a schedule demands. It is necessary for these individuals to realise that not all aspects of the university experience need to be juggled at once.

Internships provide a good deal of experience in the ‘real world’, with the promise of a salary providing students with a significant incentive (especially with the spectre of student loans awaiting graduates). However, they are by no means the be all and end all. Despite the latest unemployment figures leading to the perception that internships will give you a head start, employers will also be impressed by a dedication to college life, or relevant experience towards the line of work you take interest in – not necessarily the first class honours you achieved.

It is important to remember that not every aspect of university leads towards your future after graduation. This is why the comments such as [those made this week](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/1555/club-chairs-lukewarm-over-bar-nights/) by the Arts & Entertainment Board on the issue of bar night policy must be admired. The fact that club chairs have a common goal towards the improvement of social events is a testament to the thriving extra-curricular side of Imperial that is often overlooked by many. Gain relevant experience for the future if you are able, but make sure to find this not only in the workplace, but elsewhere too.
