Claudia Schulz, a PhD student in the Department of Computing, has been awarded Imperial College’s Best Graduate Teaching Assistant Award. She hopes that “showing children what cool tech jobs are out there and having role models” is a great way to increase the number of female scientists. By becoming a Teaching Scholar in her department and a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy she hopes to be part of that legacy. Currently her research involves argumentation precision making. She is studying the process of human choice making and to construct machines that operate similarly. At the moment ‘Answer Set Programming’ computes into structured argumentation ABA\ASPIC +, however, humans might not be able to decipher the coding. So Schulz is hoping to build machines that can make accurate decisions and take us through the decision making process too, which could help us in decision making.
