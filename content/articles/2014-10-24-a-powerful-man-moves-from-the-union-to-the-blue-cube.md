Dr Philip Power is finally leaving the Union after 16 years of involvement at Imperial College London, first as an undergraduate, then a postgraduate and finally as a member of staff for Imperial College Union.

During his time as a student at Imperial, first in the Department of Mathematics and then as a PhD student in the Department of Earth Science he was heavily involved with the Union, including being on the Recreational Clubs Committee, of which he was the Chair for three years, from September 2002 to June 2005.

After completing his PhD in 2005, he then joined the Union Staff where he became the Membership Services Manager, dealing with many of the major Clubs, Societies and Projects matters including life and associate memberships and tankards, among other things. The last of these lead to him receiving the title of Tankard Baron.

However Dr Power is not leaving the Imperial Bubble completely, as he has found himself a new home in “the Blue Cube” on the South Kensington Campus, moving over the road to become the new Faculty Education Officer for the Faculty of Engineering.

To celebrate the end of this long period of work, the Union is hosting a leaving party with a guest list that boasts some of the biggest names from Union history as well as current staff and students, with the event being described by some as “the Party of the season”.

Dr Power has been a highly regarded member of Union staff, making fine use of his considerable knowledge of the Union and College to enhance the student experience.

When asked whether the Union staff would miss Phil Power, Felix was told: “Our loss is College’s gain.”
