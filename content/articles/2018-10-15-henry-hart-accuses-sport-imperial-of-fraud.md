Fraud: Wrongful OR criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain. At least that’s the definition google gives me. It perfectly describes the situation that Sport Imperial has created with its new scheme to increase Ethos fees to £30 a year. Yes, I could hardly help but hear you screaming through the page that this is an incredibly good deal for students - I agree. However, it was not the deal I made when I handed over my £40 for use of Ethos for the entirety of my degree. Charge freshers this new reasonable fee but Sport Imperial are not entitled to void their contract with all previous gym users. That is fraud.

I was so astounded at this recent revelation, such that I could not believe that Sport Imperial would commit fraud, that I went to the Sport Imperial stand at Freshers’ fair and asked the representative to clarify the situation. To my shock he confirmed that even people who had paid the £40 would be required to pay £30 a year for gym access. He then qualified this by saying that Sport Imperial had consulted with the relevant student bodies, whatever that means, and that the gym facilities had been improved. Well that’s all very well and good, but that DOES NOT give you the right to void your contract with me or any other student who was conveniently left out of this ‘consultation’. And it was a contract. Aside from the legality surrounding the ‘verbal contracts’, a true Englishman’s word is his bond, and for Sport Imperial to cast that principle aside shames this organisation and this University. I am disgusted that the union is condoning fraud.
