As a final year student with 2 solid internships under my belt and a high 2:1 with the possibility of a first I can't help but feel put out when women with lower grades and less work experience are preferentially taken by companies due to groups such as women in engineering. Now, I understand its likely ill get a torrade of abuse for being "ignorant" and everyone will probably say I know nothing of how difficult it is to be a woman i

A [forum on sexism](http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/blogs/2012/02/29/women-at-imperial-is-everything-ok/) at Imperial College was held on Tuesday, with the intention of investigating the extent of sexism within the college as well as brainstorming plans on how best to address it.

Earlier this term, a proposal to create a feminist society was submitted to the New Clubs Committee, who rejected it on the grounds that it would largely fill the same role as [Women in Science, Engineering and Technology](http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/scc/women_in_set/home.html).

In light of this and other recent issues, [Deputy President (Welfare) Nicolas Massie](http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/blogs/category/sabbs/dpw/) held a forum for a general discussion. It involved short talks from the Equality and Diversity Unit as well as group discussions to answer questions, such as those regarding the role of the Gender Equality Officer (a position few people know exists), the need for and specific aims of a feminists’ society, and if there is sexism and barriers to success for women at Imperial.

The forum concluded that that a society should be founded with the aims of raising awareness, providing a safe space where people who have been mistreated can go for help, and outreach –promoting gender equality both at Imperial and in schools and the wider community. Further details will be provided when available.
