In this [whirlwind of mathematics](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Finding-Moonshine-Mathematicians-Journey-Symmetry/dp/0007214618), du Sautoy provides us with an irresistible combination of anecdotes, mathematical mysteries and history. Articulately conveying his own love for the subject whilst also providing us with a plethora of mathematics, he weaves an intricate and emotive tale of the fundamental questions in mathematics.

Marcus du Sautoy is a brilliant populiser of mathematics and author of several other books, one of his greatest strengthes being that he never patronises the reader, maintaining a belief that the wider public can and should understand maths.

It is this complete faith in the reader that makes the book so compelling, as is du Sautoyís humble writing; he is personable and describes his passion for and reliance on the subject. It is clear, however that perhap maths needs Sautoy as much as he needs it. Read this book – I challenge you not to learn something.
