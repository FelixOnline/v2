"I can drink tea until the cows come home and I love the atmosphere.” – Z. Budd

“Tea is instant wisdom – just add water” – A. Alauda

My most recent experiment involved a very ancient tradition. One that is the same in Chinese as in Persian, Urdu or Dari. The word is ‘chai’

Now, such research is not because puny efforts at lifting floating weights in aqua aerobics has not done much for the strength of the mind, and neither have countless tests. This investigation is because of a solid attempt to actually investigate the link between tea, meditation and life.

Tea is a way of life. No joke. In some cultures, drinking tea is the most wonderful way to relax. You have your pot of hot water, tea leaves, honey and cup, and for a few moments drinking flavoured hot water and ‘being’ is a special moment.

So how does this link to meditation? The way of the tea is the link. The art of making it and mastering the mintiness, honey and tea (for example not ever adding cold water). When you focus on the cup and tea, emptying your mind. Feeling numb. You’ll pretty much be reaching Nirvana. Soon.

To say it was a bit of a surprise to discover that there was Echinacea tea, lemongrass to even lavender tea, would be an understatement. My narrow world had been shown some light. After mixing many teas, and actually feeling unwell prior to this, I stumbled upon the right mix of mint leaves, cardamoms, lemongrass and ginger tea. Surprisingly, it was curing. Nowadays I have an obsession with teas, I think, which would totally contradict that with trees. This is because of incorrect meditative practice. The point of meditation isn’t to focus on a object (or a flickering candle), but actually feel at peace.

Tea makes you strong and healthy, without any of the artificialities or fickle synthesis. Just the way mother nature intended. From leaf to clay. In harmony.

It is a part of our daily lives, what if we actually questioned and thought about the ‘why’. Why the tradition of tea. In a world where modern utopia is on the surface overtaking zeitgeist, the core remains entrenched in tradition. Chai matters.

For tea, over which many humourous observations and reflections were made. I hope the link between tea, meditation and life is unclear. Because in life, you’ve got to master your own mind in meditation over tea, instead of listening to a lost cause ramble on.
