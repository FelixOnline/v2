Reading staged a second half fightback to stun Imperial and dash their hopes of topping their league table this season.

Reading started the match playing with the wind in their favour and used it to their advantage, pinning Imperial within their half for the first few stages of the game. With the wind against them, Imperial struggled to get out of their 22 with clearance kicks only making little ground. Reading failed to take the lead from a penalty and subsequent poorly taken tactical kicking attempts by Reading led to repeated 22 drop outs by Imperial. Reading’s failure to take the lead spurred Imperial on and they soon took the lead with Charlie Esberger touching down from a driving maul which was set up from a well won line out within Reading’s 22. Esberger’s try was converted by fly-half James Hayward from a wide right position. Imperial stuck to their pattern well, particularly using pick and goes to good effect, wearing out the Reading pack and sucking in numerous defenders. Imperial’s good work paid off and they were rewarded with another try, almost identical to the first, this time scored by captain, Caloan Cotter. Again, Hayward added the extras from an almost identical position to his first. Reading offered little in response with Imperial defending well against their limited attacks. Reading added a solitary penalty to the score line to give Imperial a healthy 14-3 lead at half time.

Following the break, Imperial appeared to sit back and let Reading attack at will. Despite this, good breaks my Chris McGeough and Toby Spittle looked like try scoring opportunities but a lack of support meant that these chances weren’t converted. Reading took advantage of Imperial’s missed opportunities and scored their first try after stealing Imperial’s ball at the lineout before spreading the ball out wide to their backs, who scored in the corner, yet they were unable to convert their try. Similarly, Reading’s second try resulted from a quickly taken penalty and the exploitation of an overlap in the backs this time Reading’s fly-half added the extras. Imperial briefly regained the lead after Hayward scored a penalty however, with three minutes to go, Reading managed to break the Imperial defence once again.

Despite a valiant effort within the remaining minutes of the game, Reading held on to secure victory over their closest league rivals.
