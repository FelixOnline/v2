On Thursday 5th February bus drivers will go on strike in a protest over pay. It will be the second time this year that a strike has taken place this calendar year over the issue, and a further two walkouts are scheduled for February 13th and February 16th.

Transport for London (TfL) has released a list of buses that will not be affected on Thursday. No bus in the vicinity of the Imperial College campus at South Kensington is expected to operate as normal, and commuters are advised to visit the TfL website ([www.tfl.gov.uk](http://www.tfl.gov.uk)) for further updates about bus routes as they come in.

The strike is due to begin at 4am on Thursday and last for 24 hours. This will result in both normal and night buses being affected. Transport for London has said it will be sending taxi marshals to major London stations to assist commuters and encourage taxi sharing. Boris Bikes will also be redistributed to places that traditionally have high demand. Passengers with bus and tram season tickets will be able to use them on the Tube.

Bus drivers are campaigning for equal rates of pay for different bus companies. Unions have described these strikes as a “last resort”.

Bus routes that will not be affected by the strike are listed below: (Source: TfL)
