The rowing club have been forced to pay £2050 in reparations to the Ambassadors Hotel in Bloomsbury, where they held their annual dinner three weeks ago.

The payment came straight from the club’s own account of Self Generated Income, which will include money the club have raised from sponsorship and membership costs. In other words, this is about a third of their income from this year’s member subscriptions.

The club's social activities remain banned until further notice, however, they are still allowed to train and last week did so with a British Rowing coach. They are also set to compete this weekend.

Union officials met with boat club trainers and the hotel this week as part of their now completed investigation. The findings are not yet public, as they will have to approved by the Union's governance committee before any further action is taken.

The £2050 fine was paid in full by the boat club last week, and will presumably go towards what the hotel claimed were substantial cleaning costs and a smashed toilet door.

Allegations about the boat club's behaviour surfaced two weeks ago, after the hotel made a series allegations regarding students' behaviour at the event. These included one student reportedly “vomiting all over [the] manager while he was explaining to you that the function was going to be stopped due to the behaviour”.

The hotel also said there had been damage to equipment, vomit found in “corridors and staircases around the hotel” and food thrown at staff.
