Sick of revising? Counting down the days until you can lounge around a marque-less Queen’s Lawn with a drink in hand? Would you like IC Radio to give you a free bottle of tequila to keep you motivated for that happy day of freedom? Should I stop asking rhetorical questions?

Jose Cuervo Tequila and Spotify are looking for the best University playlist across all Universities in the UK. The playlist with the most votes will win the ultimate night out on campus on Thursday 16th May 2013, and IC Radio has made a playlist to win you that gig! With DJ sets by Alexis Taylor from Hot Chip and The Maccabees it promises to be a legend-(wait for it)-dary night out. But a free gig isn’t the only reason to vote: here at IC Radio we have suddenly come into a plentiful supply of ice cold Jose Cuervo, and we want to share the joy with everyone who votes for our playlist.

Head online to www.voteforourplaylist.com to vote for IC Radio’s playlist, and tweet us @IC\_Radio with #Imin, or Facebook us at [facebook.com/icradio](http://facebook.com/icradio) to be in for a chance to win a bottle of Jose Cuervo tequila on Sunday 5th of May. If you’re boycotting the social media from your carefully guarded seat in the library, then you can also email us at studio@icradio.com once you’ve voted.

Other prizes you could win include Microsoft Surface tablets, ASOS vouchers, and festival tickets. So vote vote vote and let us know when you have, and this Sunday IC Radio will pick some lucky voters to win a bottle of ice cold tequila!
