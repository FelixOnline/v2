___Who’s in the Spank Alley?___
__Matt__: I’m Matt, first year PhD student and I play the drums
__Jermyn__: Jermyn, 3rd year Biochemistry, undergraduate. I play the saxophone.
__Faris__: I’m Faris. I’m a 3rd year PhD student and I play the piano.
__Jordan__: Jordan, also 3rd year PhD. Bass.
__Eugene__: Eugene. I’m a 3rd year undergrad Chemist and I play the guitar.

___Eugene, I have to ask you about your guitar. It’s just beautiful.___
__Eugene__: It’s a 1965 Gibson hollow body. I bought it on Demark Street downtown, which is the worst place to buy a guitar because they’ll just rip you off. Good place to window shop though.

___Do you know its history?___
__Eugene__: The shop owner said he bought it off someone after a gig in the 1970s. That’s what he says anyway.

___Jordan, I noticed you were only using one effect pedal in rehearsal tonight. What’s wrong? Are you okay?___
__Jordan__: I’m having withdrawal symptoms already. That’s what the ale’s for.

___So do you prefer to go light on the crazy stuff with the jazz band?___
__Jordan__: It’s not really appropriate is it…

___Do you ever go through episodes where the other guys let you do your thing?___
__Jordan__: Not really…

___So do you feel repressed with this band?___
__Jordan__: Haha na, it’s just a bit of a change. Just walking bass lines.

___Jordan and I were going to play at _____THROB_____ but we only jammed once.___
__Jordan__: We could have gone for half an hour of feedback to be honest.

___When I came into your rehearsal tonight I noticed something different right away: you guys were all playing from sheet music. Are you guys classically trained?___
__Jordan__: Don’t look at me.

___How long have you been playing your instruments?___
__Jermyn__: 11 years.
__Matt__: Same for me. Half my life.

___Gone…___
__Matt__: Just gone…

___…behind the drums. Bashing away at the past.___
___Keys?___
__Faris__: About 20 years I think. I only got into jazz about 6 years ago though. Before that I was just playing whatever, just by ear. I’m jealous of people who can actually sight read. I’m not one of those people.

___When I learned to sight-read I just ended up memorising the songs and pretending to read long.___
__Jordan__: That sounds familiar.

___I do envy those people though. You can think about music in a completely different way. You can see real patterns on the pages and if you’re trying to write rather than improvise you can play with those forms.
 So what have you been playing lately?___
__Jermyn__: We play a lot of Herbie Hancock covers.
__Matt__: It seems to be our preferred thing right now.
__Eugene__: Not so much jazz any more. More funk, but it’s a good thing.
__Matt__: Yeah, we’re playing an Average White Band song.

___Any traditional standards?___
__Faris__: Yeah.

___I wouldn’t call Herbie Hancock traditional jazz though…___
__Jordan__: Traditional jazz-funk! Well we started playing some more traditional stuff…
__Eugene__: Miles Davis as well.
__Faris__: ‘Spain’, ‘Caravan’…

___No Kind of Blue?___
__Matt__: ‘So What’!

___Don’t you need an upright for that?___
__Jordan__: I’ve got one actually.

___Dude! Get it out!___
__Jordan__: Stick a Big Muff on it haha
__Matt__: Of course our real aim is to become a 70s disco band.
__Jordan__: I’m trying to grow an afro right now.

___Don’t count on it.___
___Jordan___: Why not? What do you mean?

___Well… 3rd year PhD. Anyway...___
___So how big’s your repertoire?___
__Faris__: We’ve got about 20 songs or so…
__Matt__: We’ve only been playing together since November. I came to Imperial the month before. These guys played before in various incarnations though. We try to play at least a couple of hours a week.
__Eugene__: This is our first proper gig actually, other than the jam nights.

___Is that because you’re playing only standards at the moment?___
__Jermyn__: In jazz it’s more about the improvisation anyway.

___Do you try to work your own thing around the old classics?___
__Matt__: One of the songs we’re playing, ‘Watermelon Man’, has turned out to be a different tune altogether.

___Do you ever play any songs in strange tunings?___
__Eugene__: It’s all been standard so far hasn’t it?
__Faris__: ‘Actual Proof’ is hardly standard.
__Eugene__: Ohhh I remembered practicing that over and over and over and over…

___So have you played the whole of the Headhunter’s record or what?___
__Jordan__: Nearly!
__Matt__: It’s so tempting to just stick with Herbie Hancock!

___Have you guys seen him live?___
__Jordan__: I have. He’s like 74 now. He still jams pretty hard. I saw Roy Haynes recently, who was rather instrumental in the 50s bebop scene. He’s 86 now and he still plays amazingly well. It’s ridiculous.
__Jermyn__: We saw McCoy Tyner recently. He was John Coltrane’s pianist

___Have you guys been to Ronnie Scott’s?___
 Matt: Yeah. My cousin actually DJs for the club part of it. He does a thing called Doing Something With Jazz.

___The ‘Queen of Motown’ Martha Reeves and the Vandellas sold out 4 nights in a row there.___
 Jordan: Yeah, it’s a classy sort of vibe. Or it tries to be.

___Not like Spank Alley I suppose!___
___So other than the London Jazz Festival which is consistently ridiculously amazing, how do you find the jazz scene in London?___
__Matt__: There’s the Jazz Café up in Camden.
__Eugene__: There’s a nice joint in Fulham…

___Club 606! I remember going there in 1st year, because it was just a few streets away from Orient House where I was. It’s in the middle of this industrial estate. You just have to find this black metal door and walk down these dingy stairs…___
__Jermyn__: Yeah, it’s underground right?

___Once you get downstairs it’s really chill though.
 There’s a really strong free jazz scene, particularly around Dalston. Are any of you guys into that?___
__Jordan__: I quite like some of that.
__Eugene__: That’s what we call our solos if they don’t work out! “That was freeform!”
__Matt__: It’s good because you can never be wrong.
__Jermyn__: Just walk off the stage to get a beer and call it ‘expression’.

___The anguish. “I need a beer. Leave me alone.” [dramatic silence for 10 minutes while you get served]
 So, I’m taking that as a no.___
__Matt__: Pretty much.

___Do you guys know Sun Ra?___
__Jordan__: Yeah! Did you go see them at Oto?

___Not the last time but I caught them during their 3-day residency which prolonged to 5 because the Icelandic volcano left them stuck in London.
 Anyway, for those of you who don’t know him, he was this free jazz guy in the 60s who took too many drugs. He had this sort of cosmic jazz take on things and he believed he was from another planet.___
__Jordan__: Yeah, he actually started playing bebop kind of stuff and somehow went…

___Backstage.
 He thought jazz was channelling the spirit of the universe or something and I can see what he meant. Jazz is some of the most exploratory music there is and much more free than classical.___
__Matt__: Classical is much more composed. There’s almost no room for free interpretation.
__Faris__: Having said that, there’s a lot of baroque music which has a lot of improvisational harpsichord passages and variations.

___I always thought that when a composer is working on his magnum opus , there must be a lot of theory behind it but there was probably some spontaneous moment which sparked it. That’s what strange about classical music. It seems so restrained though, it almost seems to lose the human element. That’s what jazz manages to save.___
__Matt__: you can say what you like about classical music but you have to admit it’s stood the test of time.

___Some people might beg to differ on that.___
__Jordan__: Some of the modern classical music is really just modern music which is scored for a full orchestra and it just seems to come off as forced. Some of the purposefully dissonant stuff really tries to say something but a lot of it just fails.

___So finally, how did your colourful name come about?___
__Matt__: ‘Spank-A-Lee’ is a song by Herbie Hancock.

___Is there no other motivation behind it?___
__Jordan__: It is funk after all so there has to be a bit of spank.
__Eugene__: What better place to get down and dirty than an alley?
