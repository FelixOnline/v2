In my close friendship circles, I have always had a bit of a reputation for getting a little too passionate about, well, pretty much everything. So, when I started to relentlessly insist that everyone should really, really, REALLY should be getting on board the Schitt’s Creek train and binge this show right now, no one was particularly surprised. However, my uncontainable passion for this show is far beyond my usual excitement levels. Having watched five seasons in just about three days – which admittedly was not my best work, but with a dissertation deadline looming on the horizon, not too shabby, I daresay – I figured that this would be an excellent place to carry on declaring my love for this little show that could, months after my original binge, and reflect on what makes this show the criminally underrated juggernaut that it is.

Having recently wrapped up its fifth (and penultimate) season, this small Canadian show has been gathering a rather impressive cult following. Unaware of its existence until just before its fifth season concluded, I decided to give the show a go after coming across several articles on my Facebook timeline hailing it as ‘the best sitcom since Parks and Recreation’, another all-time favourite of mine.

**So what is Schitt’s Creek about?**

Schitt’s Creek tells the story of the once-incredibly-wealthy Rose family, who find themselves completely broke, thanks to a crooked business manager. They lose everything. Well, everything except a small town called Schitt’s Creek which they had bought as a joke for their son’s 16th birthday. Although a rather familiar, arguably simple premise, it is immensely elevated by the acting, the writing, and most importantly, the heart. So, do read on as I go through all the different things that made me fall deeply in love with this show.

**Keeping it in the family**

Created by the real-life father-son duo Eugene Levy (American Pie, anyone?) and Dan Levy, the show stars the two Levy’s as the family patriarch, Johnny, and the flamboyant son, David. Eugene Levy’s daughter, Dan’s sister, Sarah Levy also has a small part, portraying the role of the aloof waitress at Café Tropical, where the family frequently dine. The family matriarch, Moira Rose, is portrayed by none other than the incomparable Catherine O’Hara (Home Alone, A Nightmare Before Christmas), who might as well be considered family to the Levy’s, having frequently worked with Eugene throughout their decades-spanning careers. One can’t help but think that one of the reasons for the impeccable family dynamics within the show may just be that these people are, in fact, family.

There are some cast members who are new to the family, though. Annie Murphy, who delightfully portrays Alexis, the Roses’ selfish, self-absorbed daughter who’s had many an adventures back in her days of wealth (kidnapped by a Thai drug lord? Check! Being picked up by the South Korean secret police? Check!). Emily Hampshire portrays the receptionist at the hostel that the Roses resort to living in perfectly and captures the essence of being an outsider to the absurd world of the Roses, much like the audience. Chris Elliott and Jennifer Robertson are also delightful in their roles as the Schitt household, who traditionally hold the mayoral position in the town. A later addition to the show, Noah Reid portrays the lovable Patrick so perfectly that one can’t help but fall more in love with him with each passing episode.

**Catherine O’Hara**

Yes, she really deserves her own section. A criminally underrated actress, O’Hara perfectly captures the essence of Moira Rose, an ex-soap star who is completely oblivious to life as most people live it. Adopting a very non-descript, hilarious accent, O’Hara often dominates the show with her pitch-perfect comedic timing. One of my favourite moments of the show is when the Roses go to a car dealership, and for some inexplicable reason, Moira decides to speak in a (brilliant, magnificent) Cockney accent to get a better deal on a car. O’Hara has just been nominated for an Emmy award for the role, so if you don’t believe me, believe the awards committee. She is a complete revelation.

**Where Everyone Fits In**

The show is careful not to identify the country where the imaginary town of Schitt’s Creek is located. However, regardless of its location on the map, there are some things about the town that people all over the world can take a few lessons from. With their town slogan of ‘Where everyone fits in’, the locals of Schitt’s Creek really care about upholding this promise. Upon the arrival of the Roses, they are pretty much embraced by the people of Schitt’s Creek in their time of need – something the Roses are most definitely not used to.

More importantly, the show is extremely graceful in its portrayal of LGBT+ relationships. Dan Levy is sensitive to display any LGBT+ relationships as, well, relationships that are no different from those between straight couples. The show also makes a point to ensure that the characters never need to justify their sexualities, and no habitant of Schitt’s Creek shows any sign of homophobia, or even any unusual interest in the lives of the LGBT+ members of their society.

**Character development **

I honestly believe that this show has some of the best character development arc ever on TV. Over time, these characters, some of whom start out as the most egotistical, unbearable characters imaginable, become people you genuinely care about. Not only do they start feeling like real people (a hard feat, given how easy it would have been to turn the characters into shadows of what they are, and simply caricatures), but as they learn how to be a family, they start feeling like a part of your family. 

**So much goddamn heart**

Although a simple premise, the show packs a punch with its heart, more so in the later seasons. The first season relies more on comedy to establish the characters properly. However, starting in season two, everything changes. The changes are always perfectly paced and perfectly placed, coming across as natural and justified. Despite still being immensely funny, the characters grow in front of your eyes, saying and doing things you would have never expected them to in previous seasons. And it is when these heartfelt moments happen that you can’t help but fall in love with the show.

In fact, a specific episode in season four contains one of the most underrated, heartfelt, incredible scene that is so grand in some ways, but with so many intricate, subtle moments acted brilliantly by the entire cast. And by no means is this a one-off occurrence. In fact, as the characters develop and the storylines ripen over time, these moments become more and more frequent, yet dotted around so wonderfully between hilarious moments that it never feels cheesy or overly kitschy. 

**Netflix!**

Dan Levy is transparent and honest about the cause of Schitt’s Creek’s growing popularity. He attributes it to the availability of the show’s back catalogue on Netflix, which has allowed even more people to discover the show all over the world, compared to when it simply aired on a small Canadian channel and a small US-based channel. 

**What’s next in store?**

It has been confirmed recently that the upcoming sixth season of Schitt’s Creek will be its last, despite growing exponentially in popularity recently. The creators want to end the show on their terms, in the right way. Although it breaks my heart that I will no longer get to spend time with the Rose family, I trust the Levy family to conclude this show as gloriously as possible. Season six has been confirmed to premiere in January 2020 and will conclude in the spring, and should be available on the UK Netflix shortly after it ends, if the pattern they followed with season five is any indication.

All five seasons are currently available on the UK Netflix, which I hope you are going on right now to save it to your list, watch the first episode, and who knows, maybe end up falling in love with it much like I have.
