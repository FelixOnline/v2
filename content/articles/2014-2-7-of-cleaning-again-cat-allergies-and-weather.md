Keep the Cat Free!

After the state of this week’s weather, aside from investing in a conspicuously branding free umbrella at the Union shop, we feel that and cat related sicknesses or allergies are of a high priority! After successive articles about the Campus Services’ poor handling of the cleaning provisions this year, Felix is fairly impressed to see that new information has been provided to students. While there is some argument that the new cleaning booklet and detailed cleaning rota should have always been in place, let alone at the start of term, it is refreshing to see some meaningful action from the department, even if it took over four months to get to the stage of releasing a booklet (for more see pg. 4).
Ignoring the fairly woeful volume of vacuum cleaners distributed amongst the student population in halls, at least they can now buy cleaning bundles from Essentials.
Finally, Monday see’s the opening of nominations for next year’s Sabbatical Team, along with many other important positions such as Departmental Representatives (the people who can get your department to improve your course), student trustees (students who are voted to sit on the Union’s highest democratic board, and much, much more.
You’d better start running!
