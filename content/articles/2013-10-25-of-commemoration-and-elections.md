Thank goodness it’s Friday!

It’s been another eventful week, with a lot of rain, lots of gowns and lots of rain.

This Tuesday the Union’s Autumn elections finished on a positive note. This year over 27% of students voted for their Union Council representatives, academic representatives and Liberation officers. The fun doesn’t stop here, now it’s time to watch the elected candidates and see how they perform during the year. Congratulations to those who won, and commiserations to those that didn’t make it, better luck next time.

The first session of Union Council is this Tuesday, so if you’re curious about what Council does, why not turn up? All members of the Union are welcome to attend and the current papers are about topics such as the Hyde Park Football pitches consultation and the Union’s stance on the new Immigration Bill. If there’s something else you think should be discussed, submit a paper! Any full member of the Union can submit a paper to Council, so don’t be shy!

Finally, this week saw the graduation of another batch of Imperial students, a large contingent of fussy parents and a long queue for photography in the Beit Quad! Congratulations to the Class of 2013, as well as the students and members of staff that were presented awards. As for the rest of us, at least now we know that if we see any other people walking around campus in gowns this year, they are either Postgraduate graduands or members of the Harry Potter society!
