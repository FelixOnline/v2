Last week, the Arts and Entertainments Board of Imperial College Union put on ArtsFest, a week-long celebration of the arts in association with Arts Imperial.

The week featured performances and events by all manner of Arts and Entertainments Board clubs, including the various musical groups, LeoSoc, and A Cappella, amongst others.

The week kicked off with the “Fantasia Film Night”, a collaboration between Sinfonietta, FilmSoc, and Imperial Cinema where scenes from Disney masterpiece Fantasia to live music. ICTV also played a number of short films.

The scheduled Big Band performance from Queen’s Tower was delayed until Tuesday due to poor weather.

The Imperial Fringe, an offshoot from the annual Imperial Festival also had one of its regular events on the Thursday of ArtsFest, looking once again at the interface of the sciences and the arts.

Various musical groups also put on concerts, including Chamber Music, Chamber Choir, IC Choir, Wind Band, and String Ensemble.

A Cappella and MTSoc also held “A Very Vocal Evening 3.0”.

One new event during this year’s ArtsFest was a writing workshop run jointly by Writer’s Society and Science Fiction and Fantasy. Chair of Writers’, Megan Lalla-Hamblin told Felix how one of the tasks was to write based on words found on the front of a “blind book date” from SciFi.

Finally, Dr Bob MacCallum (Life Sciences) gave a lecture on the role of audiences in the development of music.
