Beyoncé killed it in this all black Proenza Schouler dress at Sunday’s Grammy’s. She wore an equally beautiful white dress on stage whilst performing _Take My Hand, Precious Lord_, which featured in the popular movie _Selma_ about the civil rights movement in the United States. Her performance was controversial since Ledizi, a jazz singer who sang the song in the movie, was not asked to perform it at the Grammy’s. Ledizi was also Grammy-nominated for ‘Best R&B Performance’ but, ironically, lost it to Beyoncé. Ledizi even told critics that she was “a little disappointed” that she wasn’t asked to perform the song. Despite the controversy, Beyoncé’s performance was flawless and she looked fabulous at the awards show.

Rihanna wore this incredible pink Giambattista Valli Haute Couture gown on Sunday night. The dress, which recently featured at Paris Haute Couture week, was the subject of much Internet buzz and memes. The Daily Mail claimed that she looked like a “giant cupcake”, whilst others have memed the dress, portraying family guy character Peter Griffith wearing the dress. Some even compared her dress to a Barbie themed birthday cake, since the skirt was so poofy and ruffly. It was even rumoured that her dress took up three seats. Others thought her dress looked like a shower loofa, but my personal favourite is an aerial photo of the audience posted by a Twitter user, joking that the dress could be seen from space.

Nicki Minaj oozed sex appeal on the red carpet in this daring Tom Ford gown. Not one to be body conscious, Nicki looked phenomenal wearing the dress, with the risqué deep plunging neckline accentuating her best ‘assets’, and the fringed peek-a-boo skirt giving us a glimpse of her toned legs.

The rapper was nominated for two Grammy’s - ‘Best Pop Duo/Group Performance’ for _Bang Bang_ with Jessie J and Ariana Grande, and ‘Best Rap Song’ for the popular hit _Anaconda_.

Although she lost both awards to Christina Aguilera’s _Say Something_ and Kendrick Lamar’s _I_, she arguably looked the sexiest of all the starlets that night.

Moving on to the worst-dressed celebrities of the night, we have Exhibit A: Madonna in Givenchy. The legendary pop star wore this questionable Spanish matador style ensemble with thigh high boots, which had no place on the red carpet. On top of the already tacky outfit, the fishnet tights and leather gloves she wore made her look like a near-retirement burlesque dancer.

To make matters even worse, the short skirt flashed her bottom to photographers, giving the world a full frontal view of her black thong. Although she wasn’t nominated for any awards, she gave an incredible performance of _Living for Love_. At least she did something right that night...

We all know that Kim Kardashian West loves to flaunt her body in revealing outfits, and she usually pulls them off. However, this train wreck of a Jean Paul Gaultier gown did nothing for her figure. Yes, the dress accentuates her cleavage, but the deep plunging neckline with the high slit is far too much skin. In the fashion world, there’s a universal rule when it comes to dresses.

If you’re going to wear a dress that accentuates your cleavage, then you shouldn’t show too much leg, and if you’re going to wear a short skirt, then you shouldn’t show too much cleavage (if you want to stay classy, that is.) Unfortunately, Kim’s dress looks more like a sparkly dressing gown than a red carpet worthy dress.

Although Charlie XCX tried to pull of the women’s suit look, she looked like more like a chav going to his high school prom. The combination of the shimmery white suit with her ruffled shirt looked like she could have bought the outfit at a thrift shop, not from Moschino. When she hit a Grammy after-party at Hollywood’s Chateau Marmont Hotel, she made an even bigger fashion mistake by changing into a skin-tight leopard print leotard. One word can summarise her fashion choices - cheap.

Charlie wasn’t nominated for a Grammy, but she still managed to perform at the after party. It sounds like Charlie XCX needs to find a new agent AND stylist.
