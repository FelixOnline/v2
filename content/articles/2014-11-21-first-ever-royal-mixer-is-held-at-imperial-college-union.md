The first ever Royal Mixer, which took place last Thursday 13th Nov 2014 at Metric, saw students from a host of other “Royal” institutions in London attend an Imperial-based social for the first time.

The event was jointly organized by the unions at Imperial, the Royal College of Music (RCM), the Royal College of Art (RCA) and the Royal Veterinary College (RVC). It saw approximately 590 attendees, of which 78% were Imperial College students.

Approximately 4.7% of the 1900 RCM and RCA population were at the event, alongside 40 RVC students out of their 2000 student population – an impressive feat given the the geographic location of the RVC.

A plethora of student bands played throughout the evening on the stage at Metric.

Those who attended the event said it was “Pretty chill, like any other night in Metric on a Thursday.

“They seem like a standard bunch.”

Union President Tom Wheeler told Felix: “I thoroughly enjoyed the evening, and really enjoyed the opportunity to meet students from other Students Union’s at our first Collaborative event of the year.

“We have received really positive feedback on the event and had lots of our members ask for a repeat event. The next Royal Mixer will be hosted by one of our neighbours, and we are planning to host another Mixer in the Spring Term.”

The event marks the first of several nights that are seeing high numbers of attendace for a Thursday night. At the time of press, the Tri Union Bar night had also reached capacity.
