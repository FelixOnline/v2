Although you attend a university blessed with a truly culturally diverse student body, you are, in one way, less diverse than you may care to believe. Home and international students alike, you are all united by the changing face of education.

This time last year we could merely attempt to predict the findings – and the consequences – of the Browne Review, the much publicised study into the future of British higher education. The following threefold increase on the cost of a degree for next year’s UK student intake, a development that was not wholly unexpected.

The real surprise was heralded by the turn of November, as the country was gripped by a wave of protests held, for the most part, by students taking a stand against the proposed rise in fees. This altogether was an unprecedented activity, even from a community with a long history of political interest and activism. At its best, it was a reminder to those in authority to stay true to their pledges.

All of you are now on the cusp of drastic changes in the world of education. For international students, unaffected by the UK’s changes to fees, the issue of reducing student visas is likely to resurface soon. There is no better time than this moment to take a pause for thought before you all take the significant leap into university life. Consider the changes still to come for those still to embark on their path through higher education, and duly make the most of your time here.

Imperial is assuredly seeking to ensure that all future education is most certainly worth the money, with but a couple of examples including the implementation of a new, deservedly praised bursary scheme in reaction to increased fees, alongside a keen interest in improving assessment and feedback – a source of particular dissatisfaction amongst many students here.

The most significant factor in determining your own satisfaction here at Imperial rests with your individual actions. You applied to a top university; you should expect an excellent education in return. If you are dissatisfied with any aspect of your course, talk to classmates or discuss concerns with your representatives. You shape your own personal university experience, and leave a legacy for years to come.

Felix, in its capacity as a newspaper serving you, the student, will continue to inform and entertain you throughout the year as this situation inevitably develops. Take an interest in the stories that surface both here and elsewhere, if not for yourselves, then for those following you into a very changed world next year.
