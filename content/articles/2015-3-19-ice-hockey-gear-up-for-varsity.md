Tonight, the Imperial Devils Ice Hockey team take on the UCL Yetis in the 3rd annual “London Ice Varsity”. The Devils will be eager to retain their unbeaten record, having triumphed two years in a row so far.

Facing off at 20:00 at Streatham Ice Arena, one of London’s great sporting rivalries will be re-ignited in a fast-paced and aggressive showdown. Reigning champions, the Imperial Devils, will be aiming to press home their Varsity dominance and come away with a 3rd win in as many years, whilst the UCL Yetis are looking to get off the mark with a ﬁrst Varsity win.

Last year’s contest saw Imperial take the crown in a nail biting sudden-death penalty shootout. Regular time saw the lead change four times, before UCL equalised within the last 10 minutes of the game to send the game into overtime at 4-4. The Devils managed to make it through the extra period, only saved by the goalpost. But when it came to the crunch, Imperial stepped up to the mark and goalkeeper Stefan Nubert cemented his MVP status by denying the ﬁnal Yeti penalty.

Without 3 goal hero Ryan Heaton and winning penalty scorer Max Fink to depend on this year, the Devils will be looking to their ranks for a new superstar to emerge and solidify their position of dominance. Captain and top point-scorer Gus Zimmerman will be leading the team from defence, aiming to deny entrance to any and all Yetis.

In regular season games this year, the Devils and Yetis are one win apiece. Both contests were hotly contested and the animosity between the teams was rarely hidden. With aggravator Ryan Ritchie once again appearing on the Imperial roster, any overﬂow in tempers could easily end in another Yeti hitting the ice after one punch.

The event promises to be another spectacle this year, with an even larger attendance. The Imperial Angels ﬁgure skating club will be making another appearance in the pre-game show, demonstrating their incredible talents. Music will be provided by Imperial’s own Steve Basher, ﬁlling up the gaps between plays and adding to the sure-to-be incredible atmosphere.

The Devils have a point to prove and, with no love lost between the teams, a strong motivation to upstage the Yetis once again. This event is not one to miss out on!

£5 tickets available from http://po.st/ImperialIceVarsity until 17:30 today, £7 tickets available on the door thereafter.
