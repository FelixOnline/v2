In a speech last Friday at Imperial, shadow chancellor John McDonnell outlined his ideas on a new form of socialism where “technology liberates rather than traps.” With full automation in the not-too-distant-future almost inevitable, it’s now time we start thinking about how Britain will adapt to a post-work society. McDonnell’s speech recognised many of the problems automation might introduce, but offered few solutions. As a party firmly rooted in the trade union movement, Labour seem woefully unprepared for a world with a workforce without work.

It’s likely that Imperial students and researchers will help bring about the automation revolution, whether through robotics or artificial intelligence. It will also be Imperial alumni who profit from the resulting mass unemployment (over the next decade 15 million jobs are at risk of automation). We might drive “future innovation in our economy”, but we could also be responsible for the largest shift of wealth in history.
> Socialism, but socialism with an iPad
In the recent past, our university has proven that it is not benevolent. With the College’s insatiable desire for funding, can it be trusted with the future of our society?

Those who own the robots and own the artificial intelligence will have the whole nation under their control; Imperial is likely to be complicit in all of this. From my experience, there is an alarming lack of discussion about the ethics of our actions. This would be okay if our politicians contemplated the consequences of automation, but few have the foresight. Unfortunately, left unregulated, the technologies we help create could cause social upheaval and society’s ultimate collapse.

Yet I still believe we should embrace automation. The possibility of a ten hour work week is enough to make it worth it. John McDonnell dreams of world “where everybody has the ability to develop their talents and enjoyment of life to the full.” This might be possible, but only if we look beyond capitalism.

The futurist left have a solution: fully automated luxury communism.

It begins with the common ownership of all that is automated, enabling luxury for all. Rather than letting giant corporations be the sole profiteers of scientific advance (which will undoubtedly have been funded in some way by the state), every citizen of Britain should have some share of the profits. We are already automating more of our transport, health care, manufacturing, admin, and retail, –this will only continue.

Take for example Über (which John McDonnell gave brief mention of in his speech), a company which is seeking to be fully driverless by 2030. We shouldn’t let a small few at the top make vast profits at the expense of everyone else; instead, a company like Über should be publicly owned or run cooperatively by the community.

If the state nationalised all automated industries, the introduction of a universal basic income would be possible. The Green Party proposed an unconditional basic income of £71 a week in their manifesto (which was unfairly ridiculed by the media). This wasn’t proposed in the context of a post-capitalist society, but it’s still a good start.

Many might argue that without competition no innovation would occur. It’s interesting that McDonnell decided to describe his economic ideas as “socialism, but socialism with an iPad.” Apple is the most profitable company in the world and arguably the greatest success story of capitalism. However, nearly all of the technology that makes up Apple’s iPad and iPhone was originally invented by state funded or state owned organisations. Without the US military, DARPA, and CERN it’s unlikely the iPad would exist today. If a state owned agency invented and produced this sort of technology in the future, luxury could be available to all.

Fully automated luxury communism isn’t a totally new idea; it’s the communism of the past reapplied in the context of the 21st century, taking full advantage of technological progress. It’s a fascinating ideology that’s completely incompatible with Labour ideals. I’m now realising that I might be in the wrong party.
