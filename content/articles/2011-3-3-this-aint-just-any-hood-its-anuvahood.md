So den, mans tinks he’s a top boi MC yeh? Well, despite the common perception that the youth of today all aspire to be the next ‘Nappy’ from N-Dubz, it appears the message from latest urban offering – Anuvahood – is that it’s perfectly acceptable to be ordinary. In a genre where almost every scene involves someone being shanked or whacked in the wedding vegetables with a baseball bat, this film stands out in stark contrast.

Anuvahood is the UK’s latest big urban comedy and delivers a satirical spoof of the ‘hoodie movie.’ Following the recent conveyor belt of gritty and dramatic urban films, Anuvahood is a comedic coming of age story which turns the themes that ran through Kidulthood and Adulthood on their head. It chronicles the desperate yet determined attempts of hapless hero Kenneth or ‘K’ ([Adam Deacon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Deacon) of Kidulthood/Shank fame) to become a respected gangster and urban music artist – or, to put it another way, get rich or cry trying.

Kenneth has just packed in his job at Laimsbury’s (witty!) and in true wannabe gangster style thinks he’s on ‘bigger tings.’ But, when his attempts at drug dealing attract the attention of the resident bad boy Tyrone, K and his crew are in bare trouble. K is forced to decide who he wants to be and what he’s prepared to do to turn his fortunes around.
> Britain’s long-awaited answer to the classic that was Ice Cube and Chris Tucker’s 1995 classic, Friday
Set in London’s concrete jungle, the film has a US-style ghetto comedy feel to it and is Britain’s long-awaited answer to the classic that was Ice Cube and Chris Tucker’s 1995 classic, [Friday](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113118/). For Anuvahood, writer, director and star Adam Deacon brings with him an ensemble of familiar British rising stars: Ollie Barbieri (Skins), Femi Oyeniran (Adulthood) and Jaime Winstone (Made in Dagenham) to name a few, as well as cameo appearances from Richard Blackwood, Ashley Walters and Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace.

The young cast holds together a refreshing comedy and, complete with a soundtrack from the likes of Tinie Tempah, Dizzie Rascal and Kano it’s certainly worth checking out. Anuvahood is out on March 18th. My advice: check if your cinema stocks Fruitellas – you’ll be wanting a pack…
