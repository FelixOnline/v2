__1. I shall not skip breakfast again__

You might have been told over and over again about breakfast being important. But it’s damn true: breakfast is the most important meal of the day and without it you’re like Justin Bieber without a fringe.
 People tend to miss breakfast either because they’re in a rush or because they think that this will help them lose weight. Either way, lack of energy and gain of weight will be the inevitable results.
 When you wake up, your body has been without fuel for about 8-9 hours (for Imperial students, 5-6 hours). Refueling properly will help you function efficiently and perform as best as you can.

__2. I shall not waste food__

No, I don’t mean to eat whatever you have in your fridge and cupboards before it expires. You should always buy based on your needs (and wants). Never overdo it. Make a list of things you need and stick to it once you enter the doors of the super market. Offers may be tempting but you are a good boy/girl and have a resolution to fulfill. Try it and see for yourself; you’ll end up spending less money and your fridge won’t get this weird smell that you never want to find the source of.

__3. I shall not visit the minimarket__

The corner shop can destroy you health-wise. There are plenty of reasons to avoid a visit: it’s more expensive than super markets; it offers less choice; and you usually end up buying crap like biscuits, crisps, soft drinks and chocolate bars. I’m not telling you to give up chocolate, that would be a crime! However, it’s not hard to realise that once you enter the local store you will leave with things you certainly didn’t want to buy before you went in. Keep it only for emergencies...

__4. I shall drink more wine...__

...responsibly.
 Wine has a strong personality other drinks don’t have. Whether you’re having steak, chicken, fish, pasta, or even just a salad, a glass of the appropriate wine does make a difference. Do your research, compare prices, and you will see that the options are limitless.

__5. I shall grill, not fry__

Fried chicken, fried bacon, fried sausages, fried eggs. You gotta love ‘em. However, it’s 2012 and this is a resolution to be respected. Grilled food is generally healthier than fried. When you fry food in butter or vegetable oils you receive a big amount of extra saturated and trans fat, both of which are no good.
 On the other hand, when you grill food, chances are you will use a marinara instead of other sauces to give taste which is again healthier. Also, excess fat will slip through the grooves in the grill compared to the fry-pan where all the fat stays (and makes the food delicious).

__6. I shall take advantage of my family__

Make a list of meals you can’t cook by yourself either because you’re incompetent or just because you “can’t be bothered” but your mother, sister, grandmother or anyone else in your family do well. Once the term ends and relief hits you what better than enjoy hot, fat, homemade food?

__7. I shall cook more__

Cooking can be very creative and most importantly it can be stress relieving.
 Following or even creating your own recipe makes you forget anything outside the kitchen. Presenting and tasting your dish will fill you with a feeling of pride and happiness.
 Try baking a cake. Decorate it. Show it to your friends, maybe offer them a piece or two. Enjoy it in the morning with coffee, tea or milk.
 Tip: Try new recipes: attempt to make it lighter by using fewer eggs and less butter, or even no eggs at all. Avoid icing and other toppings; they will just fatten the cake without adding any special taste. Use fresh or compote fruits, like strawberries and pinneapple.
 Once you have perfected your cake send your recipe at __[food.felix@imperial.ac.uk](mailto:food.felix@imperial.ac.uk?subject=I%20haz%20a%20recipe)__.

__8. I shall go out__

Let’s face the facts: Firstly, you live in London. Secondly, you study in South Kensington. Go out! Once every week or fortnight visit a restaurant you’ve been thinking about. The choice is yours. Italian, French, American, Greek, Chinese, Turkish; the choices are unlimited. Gather your friends and have a nice dinner out... now that you have time – May is not far away!

__9. I shall have a full fridge__

No, I don’t mean hitting the supermarket, spending £100 and filling up your fridge. Keep your fridge ‘updated’ with healthy foods. Always have milk, fruits, vegetables, mustard (which is low in fat), low fat cheese (e.g. mozzarella), eggs etc. That way, even if you get back from college late at night, or you’re too bored to go to the supermarket, you won’t get into the temptation of ordering a delivery and making a snack with what you have.
_Tip_: Fill your fridge every once or twice a week according to your diet and needs and try to have it emptied by the end of the week. Your goal is to receive the correct amount of fruits, vegetables, milk and other foods you always neglect to get.

__10. I shall contribute to the Food Section__
