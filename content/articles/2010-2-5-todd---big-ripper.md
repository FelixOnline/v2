For some this will sound like the equivalent of musical diarrhoea. But for fans of lo-fi noise-rock in the vein of Times New Viking and Wavves, this is a glorious piece of work. The third LP from this London-based band isn’t easy on the ear, featuring heavily saturated guitars and incomprehensible screaming. But there are inspired moments throughout: flirting with doom-metal and stoner-rock. On a whole, it’s an abrasive, messy success.
