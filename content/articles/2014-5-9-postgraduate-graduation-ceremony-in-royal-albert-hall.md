This week 2,700 students graduated from various postgraduate course in the Royal Albert Hall.

The ceremony, held on Wednesday, was the last postgraduate graduation event held in the history of Imperial, students received their degrees while observed by an audience of 6,000 supporters, spread over three sessions throughout the day.

As with the undergraduate ceremony the Union President David Goldsmith gave a speech to the graduating students, and each shook the hand of President and Rector Sir Keith O’Nions.

In a speech, Sir Keith said, “Each of you has been at the frontier of your subject. You have pushed, tested and in many cases moved the boundaries of knowledge and achieved a new level of understanding. The full impact of your achievements and success will unfold down the years as your careers develop further.”

The day also saw honours being conferred on several notable academics, with Professor Dudley Brian Spalding FRS, FRAE, retired Professor of Heat Transfer receiving an honorary degree in recognition of his research into Computational Fluid Dynamics, followed by Dr Rodney Eastward, a former College Secretary, upon whom was conferred an Imperial College Medal for outstanding contribution to the life and work of the College.
