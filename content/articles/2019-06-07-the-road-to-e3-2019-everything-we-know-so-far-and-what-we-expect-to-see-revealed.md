Officially, the expo runs for three days. However, the E3 phenomena is more than just the LA convention. It encompasses all the announcements for new computer and video game releases, as well as the teasing of new video game hardware. From publishers announcing the next set of DLC as a means of breathing life into their existing franchises, revealing new IPs, and giving fuel to the fans for their console wars, one could say E3 2019 lasts weeks, with many announcements for major series having already been made this week and more to be released next week.

For the EA Play livestream, EA has sent a breakdown of their broadcast to TechRadar:

**Microsoft** 

_Conference Date: Sunday 9th June._ 

_Time: 9:00 PM BST._ 

_Viewing Platforms: Xbox One, Mixer.com, YouTube, Twitch_

With the absence of Sony at E3, but the internet rife with rumours of the PlayStation 5, the Xbox E3 Briefing would be the best opportunity for Microsoft to make waves this month with the announcement of the next generation of the Xbox, currently codenamed Project Scarlett. Industry insiders  have suggested that if Microsoft does do an official annoucement for their next gen console, then there will be successors to both the Xbox One X and the Xbox One S.

Most likely though, it will be the Project xCloud which will be the hardware focus of this conference, as an answer to Playstation Now and the recently announced Google Stadia.

In terms of video game titles, we can expect more information and  official annoucements for _Halo Infinite_ , _Gears 5_ and a new _Forza_ title.

**Bethesda**

_Conference Date: Monday 10th June._ 

_Time: 1.30 AM BST_ 

_Viewing Platforms: Twitch, YouTube, Twitter, Mixer and Facebook_

A recent statement from Todd Howard has indicated that we will not be seeing Bethesda’s new sci-fi IP, _Starfield,_ nor _Elder Scrolls VI_ at E3 this year.  Not the biggest disappointment from Bethesda (that would be _Fallout 76_ ), but this does leave us to speculate on what Bethesda will be showing this year. 

The most obvious options would be content updates to the _Elder Scrolls Online_ and _Fallout 76_. Additionally, we should expect more information about _Doom Eternal_.

Sadly, it’s unlikely that we will get a new edition of _Skyrim_ at this E3.

**Devolver Digital**

_Conference Date: Monday 10th June._ 

_Time: 3.00 AM BST_ 

_Viewing Platforms: Twitch_

Amongst the big name publishers, we have Devolver Digital giving room to indie developers. In case you don’t know about this publisher, then some of the games that they have published in the past include: _Hotline Miami, Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition, Always Sometimes Monsters, The Talos Principle and Hatoful Boyfriend_. 

With some sequels being developed currently including _The Talos Principle 2, Sometimes Always Monsters_ as well as some games releasing later on in 2019, _Metal Wolf Chaos XD, My Friend Pedro, Serious Sam 4: Planet Badass,_ we’re in for a conference filled with unexpected shenanigans and wacky games.

**PC Gaming Show**

_Conference Date: Monday 10th June._ 

_Time: 6.00 PM BST_ 

_Viewing Platforms: Twitch, Facebook and YouTube_

Developers and hardware makers for PC are invited to participate in the PC Gaming Show. PC Gamer has revealed that they are expecting a lot of titles to showcase during the two hour livestream.

If you’re excited by stepping into the shoes of a supervillain for a second time, then the world’s first reveal of Evil Genius 2 will be right up your alley. Developer Rebellion will also be revealing an unannounced title. New footage of Last Oasis as well as the projects that developer Tripwire Interactive has been working on will be featured.

Gearbox will take the stage and discuss the upcoming Borderlands 3 in depth To coincide with the upcoming release of Borderlands 3, Borderlands 2 will be receiving a free DLC update to set the stage for the sequel.

Expect more information from Paradox Interactive about Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 and Age of Wonders: Planetfall. 

Samsung is also expected to reveal more information about their gaming monitors.

The PCGaming Show is expected to have many more titles both announced and unannouced so far.

**Ubisoft**

_Conference Date: Monday 10th June._ 

_Time: 9.00 PM BST_ 

_Viewing Platforms: Twitch and YouTube_

Ubisoft has recently teased what people should expect for their E3 conference and this includes updates to existing games and a celebrity showdown.

Current titles expected to make an apperance at E3 include _For Honor, Rainbow Six Siege_ and Tom Clancy’s _The Division 2_.

A tweet from the official Watch Dogs twitter account has confirmed that the third game in this franchise, titled _Watch Dogs Legion,_ will be appearing at E3. This game will be set in London. Rumours have it that you will be able to play as any of the NPCs in the new setting of London.

The focal point of this conference is likely to be _Ghost Recon Breakpoint_ which has an October 2019 release, meaning that this game will likely  get extensive attention during the Ubisoft briefing.

Ubisoft has annouced that they are working on three brand new AAA titles, so it is possible that these three games could also be teased during their broadcast.

**Square Enix**

_Conference Date: Tuesday 11th June._ 

_Time: 2.00 AM BST_ 

_Viewing Platforms: Twitch and YouTube_

With Sony’s State of Play broadcast last month teasing fans with a short reveal for the _Final Fantasy VII Remake,_ and after Square has been notably silent on the project for years, speculation has been fueled on whether this game will be making an appearance at E3. Who knows, maybe, we might get a release date.

_The Avengers Project,_ which is currently being worked on by Crystal Dynamics and Edios-Montreal alongside direct involvement from Square Enix and Marvel Entertainement, will have an official annoucement at E3 2019, which so far has only had a small teaser in 2017.

Square Enix has been quite silent this year, with the release of _Kingdom Hearts 3_ in January, followed by a critical mode content update in April. With the DLC, Kingdom Hearts 3: Re:MIND, slated for a 2019 release, E3 would be the best time for Square Enix to do a reveal for the new scenario.

_Dragon Quest XI_ is also releasing for the Switch later this year, so it might also be a part of the conference this year. Additionally, we may get more info about _Dragon Quest Builders 2_ for the Nintendo Switch.

**Nintendo**

_Conference Date: Tuesday 11th June._ 

_Time: 5.00 PM BST_ 

_Viewing Platforms: Twitch and YouTube_

The June 5th Nintendo Direct gave us a few details about the upcoming _Pokemon Sword and Shield_ for the Nintendo Switch. We can expect a full depth annoucement of several details pertaining to the first ever home console mainline Pokemon games during the Nintendo E3 Direct.

From Nintendo’s big franchise, _The Legend of Zelda_ and _Mario,_ it is very unlikely that we will see anything about their next big mainline games. However, what we can expect is information about the _Link’s Awakening_ remake and _Mario Maker 2_.

There’s some speculation on whether we will see another beloved franchise, _Animal Crossing,_ during this year’s E3 Direct, as the game does have a 2019 launch window.

_Super Smash Bros Ultimate_ had it’s most recent content update in April, where the first DLC Fighter, Joker from Persona 5, was added to the game. There are still four DLC fighters to be announced. Could we get a teaser of the second DLC fighter at E3? Possibly.

Other games which could make an apperance include _Luigi’s Mansion 3_ and _Fire Emblem Three Houses_.
