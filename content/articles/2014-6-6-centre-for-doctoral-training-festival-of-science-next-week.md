The annual Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) Festival of Science will be happening on Friday 13th June 2014 in the SAF lecture theatres. It is a chance for CDT students to come together to organise and present a showcase of current science and scientific issues to the Imperial College London research community.

The 2014 festival focuses on the theme of “Science and the Media”. Featuring speakers from a number of disciplines and positions within the scientific world, we hope to bring you a range of perspectives on working with the media and engaging the public as a scientist.

The day is also an opportunity for the four CDTs to communicate with each other and gain a more detailed understanding of the work that is carried out in each field. This year we will have presentations of the achievements and aspirations of the outgoing cohorts of each CDT, this being the graduation year of the first cohort for many CDTs.

Speakers will include Johnjoe McFadden, Brian Fuchs and Lewis Darnell. There is a poster competition with a £250 prize for the best poster as well as prizes for other entrants. Find out more at: __http://www.cdtfestival.co.uk__
