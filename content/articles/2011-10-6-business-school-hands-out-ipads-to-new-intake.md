     "We want our students to understand everything about these new and rapidly changing technologies and how to make the best use of them." No offence to the business school, but frankly I think today's young generation of students has a much better understanding of Facebook / Twitter / Wordpress etc. than their grey-haired lecturers. Thumbs up to new technologies, but the ACADEMIC reputation of Imperial needs to be maintained. This is a university that should teach people how to use their BRAINS, not so much how to use Twitter. ,So that's where the £9000 tuition fees are going.,Not true the MSc in Marketing is £19,500 of which all is paid by the student/sponsor..you can get a student loan for it.,Sorry that should be "can't get a goverment uk student loan for it",Kool Aid Marketing,I agree with anon, it's a typical Business School gimmick really, it just goes to prove their students have more money than sense if they bleat on about 'wonderful' a gift it is. They should really be more concerned with knuckling

Imperial College Business School is welcoming its ﬁrst students of a new Masters programme and providing them with a free iPad 2 with which to carry out their studies. The programme leaders of the [MSc in Strategic Marketing](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/programmes/msc-strategic-marketing) are scrapping the traditional paper-based learning and teaching methods and pioneering a novel approach centred on the use of digital and social media.

At the start of each lecture, QR (Quick Response) codes will be used, allowing students to download the PowerPoint slides directly to their iPad. Apps such as [GoodReader](http://www.goodiware.com/goodreader.html), [iAnnotate](http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/iannotate-pdf/id363998953?mt=8) and [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/) will also be used to facilitate note taking.

Students are being asked to carry out their research and coursework using sites such as [Posterous](https://posterous.com/), [Facebook](http://facebook.com) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com), work which will be facilitated by the iPad. Coursework will involve building websites, creating wordpress blogs, making applications and ﬁlming videos via iMovie.

An online “Communication hub” has also been created for the course that allows students to ask questions and discuss topics with lecturers and other students, as well as share ﬁles and videos. It is also hoped that the feedback time from lecturers to students will be reduced, enhancing student satisfaction.

Behind the development of this new course is its Director, Colin Love, who explains that “instead of just being a marketing programme where we trot out all the standard books”, the Business School has attempted to “turn it around into being something that focuses on the latest technology, communication techniques and social media networks.”

“Marketeers cannot underestimate the power of the digital and social media age. If you looked at the users of Facebook as a population, they would represent the third largest ‘country’ in the world. Customer experience on here can make or break a brand overnight and our teaching reﬂects this shift,” said Colin Love.

“We want our students to understand everything about these new and rapidly changing technologies and how to make the best use of them, and a large part of that is immersing the students in that world from day one.”

Ludovica Arci, a student on the programme, told Felix that “the whole class is extremely happy about this ‘gift’, especially because we do not have to give the iPads back.” She also added that “the iPad is much more than a gift from Imperial College but it is a real revolution and a new way of conceiving the educational system.”

Colin Love believes that the MSc in Strategic Marketing “will equip students with the marketing skills that are immediately relevant for companies, business leaders and entrepreneurs around the world.” Applications for next year’s programme open in November.
