Junior doctors are not going to accept the new contracts that Jeremy Hunt is trying to impose on them, so they’re planning three more strikes as well as launching a judicial review. The government condemned the announcement, arguing that the contract will improve services. However, Dr Johann Malawana (leader of the BMA junior doctor division) states that the general consensus amongst junior doctors is rejecting the imposition: “the government must put patients before politics.” Also the BMA have found legal grounds for a challenge and if the Equality Act (2010) equality impact assessment has not been carried out, they will take the government to court. However, Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers stated that the majority of the BMA’s concerns had been addressed in the final contract and urged junior doctors to reconsider. This is the most bitter clash since the creation of the NHS.
