With the summer upon us, it means the inevitable onslaught of blockbusters. By normal standards, 2015’s a pretty quiet year for the summer, with most of this year’s big hitters either already out, or landing towards Christmas time (_Star Wars_, I’m looking at you).

But don’t worry – once you’ve finally made your way through the likes of _Mad Max: Fury Road _(seriously, go and watch it again already) and _Jurassic World _(I have no opinions on this yet), there’s still plenty of cinema to indulge in.

We’ve got unnecessary reboots (_Terminator_), yet more sequels (_Ted_), the odd genuinely exciting new work (_Inside Out_) and plenty more besides.

We also have a healthy dose of sarcasm about all of them, because that’s just how we roll.

### _Minions _(26th June)

As if your life wasn’t already overflowing with the yellow critters from the _Despicable Me _series, they’re back in an all-new film of their own. That’s right, there’s a whole film comprised exclusively of the barely comprehensible, impossibly idiotic Minions. Because stealing the show in two films and commanding an entire series of adverts for Sky weren’t enough. Thanks, Universal.

Having said that, this’ll probably still be fairly amusing. Minions, despite being literally everywhere, are still funny.

### _Terminator Genisys _(3rd July)

Did somebody say “unnecessary reboot”? I mean, I definitely did, but just in case someone else felt like chiming in with that opinion. Because that’s what we’re getting.

The _Terminator _franchise lumbers back to life following two attempted murders via film – the so-so third entry (_Rise of the Machines_) and the downright dire _Terminator Salvation_. Despite director McG’s best efforts, the series survives. And it’s bringing back the original Terminator, for real this time.

It’s also completely changing the game, ending up in a sort of parallel universe where the original Terminator brought up an orphaned Sarah Connor (now played by Emilia Clarke). So there’s that. Trailers for the film have done their best to spoil all of the major plot twists, but hopefully there’s still something up the sleeve of director Alan Taylor, fresh off the likes of _Game of Thrones _and _Thor: The Dark World_. Clearly not a dictionary, however.

### _Ted 2 _(10th July)

Seth MacFarlane’s foul-mouthed teddy bear makes his second appearance in the inevitable sequel to the hit comedy. The likes of Liam Neeson and Amanda Seyfried join the cast, with the latter playing a lawyer whose name bears an uncanny resemblance to another popular film star. Mark Wahlberg returns as Ted’s “thunder buddy for life” John, although Mila Kunis opts not to reappear as his girlfriend. Fair enough. The film is set to centre around Ted’s attempts to have a baby with his (human) girlfriend, and his need to prove he is a person in the eyes of the law before this is allowed Whether you enjoy it or not is likely to depend on your opinions of the first film, of _Family Guy,_ and of Seth MacFarlane’s work in general.

### _Ant-Man _(17th July)

Admit it, you forgot this was coming out, didn’t you? Originally the work of Edgar Wright, the latest Marvel film (and the first of Phase 3) is now under the command of Peyton Reed, the man behind _Yes Man_. Not the most promising of CVs, but the latest trailer suggests there’s much to be hopeful for.

Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang is a criminal, but one given a chance at redemption by scientist Dr Hank Pym. Armed with a suit that allows him to shrink (but increase his strength in the process), he’s tasked with carrying out a heist like no other. _Ant-Man_ looks to be one of the Marvel films that leans more heavily towards the comedy side of things, if Thomas the Tank Engine’s appearance in the trailer is anything to go by, and there’s still plenty to be hopeful for. Marvel haven’t put a foot wrong yet.

### _Inside Out _(24th July)

Pixar haven’t been on their best form of late, trapped as they are in the land of sequels. The fact that _Inside Out _is a new IP from some of cinema’s greatest minds should be exciting enough. The fact that the early reviews are already declaring it to be amongst Pixar’s finest work – a heady claim – should be even more so.

Set inside the mind of Riley, an 11 year-old-girl, _Inside Out _follows the personifications of the emotions inside her head, lead by Joy (Amy Poehler). After a move across the States, Joy and Sadness find themselves trapped in the far corners of Riley’s mind, and Anger, Fear and Disgust are left in charge in Headquarters.
