Following a large number of meetings being cancelled, the Union Executive Committee has met for only the second time this academic year. Charged with overseeing the general running of the Union and enacting policies of Union Council, Exec is scheduled to meet once a month. However this year a lack of agenda items has led to most of the meetings being cancelled: the other meet took place until January.

When asked why a lack of agenda items seems to be an on-going problem with Exec, David Goldsmith, Union President and Chair of Exec, said that the Committee probably needs to have the scope of work reviewed. This is despite the fact that last year in the same period last year Exec met 9 times. The lack of meetings has led to what little items of business there were being decided on by electronic vote, which has lead to some concerns over how the Union records such decisions.
