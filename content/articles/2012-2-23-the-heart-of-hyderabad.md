Hyderabad city, India. Capital of the state of Andhra Pradesh, the second largest city in South India, and my hometown for the first few years of my life. Having lived in Hyderabad for almost a decade, and visited the place virtually every year since, you can understand why the city is extremely close to my heart. It would undoubtedly be impossible for me to write about everything Hyderabad offers in a mere few hundred words, and I wouldn’t dare attempt it, so I’m going to tell you about a few of my favourite sights.
> Hyderabad is a perfect mix of historical charm and bustling modern areas
Hyderabad is a perfect mix of alluring historical charm, reflecting the town’s heritage, and bustling modern areas: a clear demonstration of the town’s progress. Quirky narrow streets, beautiful mosques and packed bazaars are unquestionably the defining features of Old City. Here, you also find Hyderabad’s most famous landmark, Charminar. The word Charminar literally means “four towers”, and this is an apt description of the monument. Charminar, which artfully houses a beautiful mosque, is a“Hyderabad is a perfect mix of historical charm and bustling modern areas”n ornate structure consisting of four minarets connected by arches. Climb up the 150 steps to the top of a minaret, and experience impressive views of the immediate Old City area and beyond.

Just off one of the side roads from Charminar is Laad Bazaar, famous for its bangle stores. The bazaar is a spectacular sight of shimmering stores and throngs of people bartering for the best prices. The shopkeepers have always reminded me of hawks as they wait around the shop entrances, swooping down on us at first sight, and luring us into their stores.
> The graceful beauty that the edifice radiates never fails to draw me in
While the Old City does have its attractions, my favourite spot is actually a more modern sight: Birla Mandir. This is a handsomely designed temple, of Sri Venkateshwara (a Hindu deity), built entirely from white marble, which is situated on top of the hill “Naubath Pahad”. The graceful beauty that the edifice radiates never fails to draw me in; and with fine, intricate carvings, the charm is definitely not lost when seen up close. Furthermore, the panoramic views of Hyderabad from the courtyard outside the temple, are simply spectacular; seeing the pinpoints of car lights and hearing the distant noise of busy city life below, a feeling of calm always envelopes me.

From the vantage point of Birla Mandir another signature sight of Hyderabad is visible. The mammoth Buddha Statue, particularly beautiful when lit up against the evening sky, is located at the centre of Hussain Sagar, a massive artificial lake in the heart of the city.
> Hyderabad’s rich history and location is what sets it apart from the rest
Surrounding these waters are an array of noteworthy attractions. Firstly, Tank bund. This is a popular promenade, where families go to buy ice-cream and coconut water from the street vendors whilst absorbing the view of the lake and the monument. Necklace Road, where one may come across the famous NTR gardens, is a recognized hangout for Hyderabadis. Here you can also find “Eat Street”; I am not exaggerating when I say that every imaginable type of cuisine can be found here. I tend to stick to the Indian delicacies, but you’ll be more than spoilt for choice, whatever your taste. Beware though, during holidays it can feel like the whole city has flocked to this area, so unless you particularly want to battle for seats and devote hours to queuing up for your food, steer clear of this zone.

Over the years, I have travelled to many parts of India and each place appeals to me in its own way. Hyderabad’s rich Indo-Muslim-British history and its geographically almost-central location within India, has shaped it into a city of many influences and this is what sets it apart from the rest. The city has so much to offer and I could continue to write about Golconda Fort, Faluknama Palace and so on, but I would never be able to do it full justice. Experience it for yourself, and like me, you may just find a spot for Hyderabad in your heart.
