Topman Ctrl are throwing free tickets at us to give to you for this show, so we're running a mini-competition for them, just email us at music.felix@gmail.com with the answer to this question:

_In the wonderfully weird video for “Ambling Alp”, what object are all the naked people at the end running towards?_

_First person to email us with the correct answer gets two free tickets. music.felix@gmail.com. Easy._

Yeasayer describe themselves as “Middle Eastern-psych-pop-snap-gospel” but actually they're an experimental indie band from Brooklyn, New York. They released their debut album All Hour Cymbals in 2007 and this year they released their follow-up, Odd Blood.

Silver Columns are a home-grown duo playing synth-pop folktronica rock techno (that's journalist words for don't-know-how-to-describe-them) that maybe sounds a bit like Hot Chip, maybe even better?

The Topman Ctrl tour involves different Channel 4 presenters hosting different bands in different cities. Nick Grimshaw is the presenter hosting this show. Now I don't know who that is but then I don't own a TV. Or a laptop. I can't even watch iPlayer! Sad times.
