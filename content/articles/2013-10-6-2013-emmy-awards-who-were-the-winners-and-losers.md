## Drama Category
####  Best Actor: Jeff Daniels - The Newsroom

Breaking Bad fans, look away now your favourite meth dealer didn’t win this year. Daniels did, for beautifully handling Aaron Sorkins’ complex screenplay in the new HBO drama.

####  Best Actress: Claire Danes - Homeland

Booooooriiiiiing: after what was less than a stellar season of Homeland, the bipolar Carrie Mathison wins again, when it really should have been Kerry Washington (Scandal)

####  Best Supporting Actor: Bobby Canavale - Boardwalk Empire

Breaking Bad fans, look away again - this man beat not one, but two of the cast members of your show. In his speech he gave a shout-out to Rose Byrne calling her the love of his life...

####

####
 Best Supporting Actress: Anna Gunn - Breaking Bad

Breaking Bad fans, it’s safe for you to look now, as one of your beloved cast members took home the gold for acting- she even triumphed over the mother of dragons- a class act.

####

####
 Best Drama Series: Breaking Bad Sad that your favourite show ended?

Let this be somewhat of a consolation- winning the top gong at this yaer’s Emmys, toughing through some stiff competition from cable channels only.
##
## Comedy Category
####  Best Actor: Jim Parsons - The Big Bang Theory

Predictable winner? Yes. Repeat winner? Yes. The most deserving? Absolutely. Not even Alec Baldwin in his final season of 30 Rock can come close to what this man does.

####

####
 Best Actress: Julia Louis-Dreyfus -Veep

This marks Dreyfus’ 4th acting Emmy win, and I stopped trying to count how many nominations she’d garnered over the years (so 10+). This woman is a comedy goddess.

####
 Best Supporting Actor: Tony Hale -Veep

Perfectly complementing the incompetent Selina Meyer, i.e. Veep, is Gary, her loyal assistant, played to perfection by Hale - and the two of them are an invaluable asset to the show.

####

####
 Best Supporting Actress: Merritt Wever - Nurse Jackie

And the prize for the shortest, sweetest, and downright best speech of the night? Wever’s, who finally got recognition for single-handedly delivering the funny scenes of her show.

####

####
 Best Comedy Series: Modern Family

Four seasons, four Best Comedy Series wins, America’s favourite family mocumentary comedy has the perfect score when it comes to winning - your luck will run out soon enough.
