_“Imagine there’s no heaven_

_It’s easy if you try_

_No hell below us_

_Above us only sky_

_Imagine all the people_

_Living for today..._

It must be accepted that we are each unique in completely different ways, physically as well as mentally. Each person has their own personal way of thinking, their own imagination which they control. It can create a world without limits of any sort. To ‘Imagine’ is simple to do. All you have to accept is that it is through imagination that human progress can be made. Let us say that, the human race is constantly evolving. Be it technologically or mentally, it is happening without us even trying.

_Imagine there’s no countries_

_It isn’t hard to do_

_Nothing to kill or die for_

_And no religion too_

_Imagine all the people_

_Living life in peace..._

Why don’t we then attempt to control the direction of our evolution of thought, as we do with material benefits? In first world societies, there is no need to fight one another for food as in the wild, like the cavemen did, because it’s provided for us by farmers in a system that has developed over many years. Considering this, it’s also not necessary for the selfishness of a human being to be as dominant as it used to be, with respect to the bare necessities of life. We all live on Earth together now, we are no longer striving to survive, we are striving only for money. In fact, if we didn’t already work together the world would now fall to pieces.

_You may say I’m a dreamer_

_But I’m not the only one_

_I hope someday you’ll join us_

_And the world will be as one_

Lennon said he was a dreamer. He also said he was not alone in his dreams, implying that there is a possibility for people to think in the same way he does. In a less selfish way.

_Imagine no possessions_

_I wonder if you can_

_No need for greed or hunger_

_A brotherhood of man_

_Imagine all the people_

_Sharing all the world”_

There is an emotion in all of us which is the feeling a child has towards their mother/father/brother/sister. There is something that feels different towards one’s own genes. Some call it Love. No matter what it is, it does exist. It’s the feeling that causes you to give your life to save that of a sibling or your own child. You wouldn’t however, give your life for a friend. Giving your life for someone else has to be a completely selfless action. Say that one boy has 5 brothers, and another boy has 10. These boys would give their lives to save that of their brothers’, however one has considerably more brothers. This doesn’t mean that his Love has been spread thinner or means less, because he would still die for all 10.

This must mean that the boy with 5 brothers also has the ability to Love another 5, or 10 even. So this emotion has no limits, in that case, can somebody Love a friend in the same way as a brother? Of course, people get married and love each other so much that they would also die for one another, the ultimate sacrifice.

I believe that with imagination, it would be possible to plant the idea of branching this brotherly love for one within one’s own vertical genetic tree, horizontally, to a friend. If this is achieved, we already know that this emotion is limitless and we could evolve to become one.
