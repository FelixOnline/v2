The Guardian Student Media Awards 2012 have been announced. I, Science, the student produced science magazine of Imperial College London and the sister publication of Felix, has made the shortlist in the category of “Student Website of the Year”. The website www.isciencemag.co.uk/ will face off against competition from Sheffield, Leeds, Birmingham, and Bournemouth, to be crowned Student Website of the Year 2012.

I, Science is the only Imperial student based media to be nominated in this year’s awards.

I, Science was started in 2005 under the editorship of Darius Nikbin, and produces an issue each term. It is mainly run and written by student on the Science Communication masters, however they welcome contributions from all students at Imperial.

The 2010-2011 team found out early and are delighted to have been nominated.
