Bad puns aside[ Imperial Fringe ](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/festival/fringe)this month is all set to put bones under microscope in an evening of skeletal debauchery on the Thursday the 29th of November.

The event, promoted as “[Imperial Fringe: Cutting close to the bone](http://www2.imperial.ac.uk/blog/studentnoticeboard/2012/11/05/imperial-fringe-cutting-close-to-the-bone-29-nov/)” is scheduled from 5.30 to 9.00pm and feature speakers including [Professor Alison McGregor](http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/people/a.mcgregor/), [Dr. Sandra Shefelbine](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.shefelbine) and [Dr. Richie Abel](http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/people/richard.abel/) in a “very special discussion on bone”.

Attendees will have the chance to build stem cell scaffolds with Professor[ Sarah Rankin](http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/people/s.rankin/) of the National Heartand lung institute at Imperial and to attempt key hole surgery using knee arthroscopy simulator.
 Dr[ Alessandra Carriero](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.carriero) a research fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering currently studying the fracture mechanics of osteogenesis imperfecta will be exploring brittle bone disease in mice with the help of chocolate and biomedical scientist [Vin Chauhan](http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/people/v.chauhan/) of the Department of Surgery and Cancer is billed to be showcasing “macabre Victorian bone specimens” from the Pathology Museum. Also on hand will be Senior Lecturer [Dr Alex Porter ](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.porter)whose work currently focuses on the visualization of interactions between cells and bio- or nano-materials; she will be “looking at how we can bond with our bones” as part of the evening’s program.

Event organiser Harriet Martin, Communications and Development, said: “With the Imperial Fringe we really want to tap into the growing appetite for hands-on, participatory science-related evening events that young people are flooding toacross London. Researchers here at Imperial are doing such exciting things, the Imperial Fringe is a great way to involve the public with their work and share their enthusiasm and expertise.”

[The event will be held at the College Main Entrance](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/festival) of the South Kensington campus is open to students, staff and the general public. While registration is encouraged (email the organizers at [festival@imperial.ac.uk](mailto:festival@imperial.ac.uk)) the event is a walk in event free to all participants. Drinks and snacks will be available at the pay bar throughout the evening where participants will also have a chance to meet speakers between 8.30 and 9.00pm.
