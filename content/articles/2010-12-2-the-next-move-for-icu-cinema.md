Over this term, we have been following the relaunch of iCU Cinema and celebrating its successes – from its sold-out opening night with Inception to its recent screening of comic-book gold Scott Pilgrim vs. The World – as it brings blockbuster films back to the comfort of the Union.

But now iCU Cinema is set to announce the return of the ‘All-Nighter’ which is sure to be welcomed by all die-hard film fanatics wishing to test their endurance in an epic 12 hour blockbuster extravaganza.

All-Nighters run in the final week of term, from 6pm-6am and features six films back-to-back, with the Union Bar opening up in between intervals all through the night. The line-up this year includes a wide range of genres from the all-star shoot-em-up The Expendables, to the controversial British comedy about terrorism Four Lions, to the critically acclaimed Facebook drama The Social Network.

We have lots to look forward to from iCU Cinema next term, too, as they look towards putting on two screenings a week. Running on the night of Tuesday 14th December, the iCU Cinema’s All-Nighter will serve as a fitting end to a highly successful comeback.
