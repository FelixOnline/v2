X-rays could help us peer back in time to see the origins of life on Earth. Fossils, the indelible mark of ancient life, have been a vital piece of evidence for Darwin’s theory of evolution. Most, however, are from a time millions of years after life started. The evidence of life’s origin has been, until this point, been too small to see.

The new technique, documented in [Nature Materials](http://www.nature.com/nmat/index.html), uses high power X-rays to form images of the chemical bonds in carbon molecules buried deep in rock. It can distinguish between graphite, diamond and other forms of carbon without distorting the sample. The scientists hope to use this technology on rocks from Mars and the Moon.
