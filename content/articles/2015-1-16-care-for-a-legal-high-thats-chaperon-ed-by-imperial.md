Imperial Professor David Nutt has begun research on a legal high that mimics ecstasy but may also stop binge drinking. The drug, known as Chaperon, is still being developed but could one day be available as a cocktail in bars across the country.

The idea of Chaperon occurred around a year ago to the anonymous Dr. Z, a mathematician who previously created mephedrone. Chaperon is the trade name for MEAI, or 5-methoxy-2-aminoindane. MEAI simultaneously invokes a chemical pleasure in those that take it and also makes alcohol seem repulsive, inhibiting consumption.

Dr. Z and Nutt hope that the drug could be taken to mitigate binge drinking but also deliver a relaxing high, described by some as an “intense euphoria.”

Dr. Z initially planned for MEAI to be sold as yet another legal high, but has now gifted the provisional patent of MEAI and a number of other chemically similar compounds to Professor Nutt’s charitable research group, DrugScience.org.uk.

This family of compounds is not particularly novel: they were discovered around 20 years ago as a means to treat depression. Although they are proven to have neurological effects, the idea to use these compounds to combat binge drinking is new however and something Nutt and his team are keen to develop.

MEAI has shown the most promise so far, so research is now underway to determine optimum doses, discover any potential side effects and look at the safest way for people to consume the drug and benefit from its influence.

Felix spoke to Nutt, who told us how the idea to address and reduce the harmful effects of alcohol is nothing new, but the direction in which to approach this is constantly evolving.

Nutt told us: “We could develop an alternative or look to produce a substance that moderates the effect of alcohol. I found that it is difficult to find alternatives to alcohol, so we need something that moderates it instead.

Chaperon can be taken with alcohol as opposed to substituting it completely. It will hopefully minimise the harm, maximise the pleasure and limit the alcohol consumption.”

So how long will it be before this wonder drug hits bars and pubs? Nutt plans to ensure that the social culture surrounding sensible alcohol consumption is maintained, telling Felix that still wants to keep people in bars, and would prefer the drug to be served as a cocktail in an more up-market bar. “I want it to appeal to people who care about their health and pleasure, but want to reduce the harm of drinking too.

“I want to put drinking back into clubs; too much drinking goes on outside this drinking environment. I would really only want Chaperon available in licensed premises, not something that people sit in front of the television swigging!”

Although the patent is provisional, with enough research and funding the drug could be issued a complete patent that will then last a further ten years and allow for the drug to be developed for commercial sales.

Clinical and human trials of the drug have yet to be conducted under controlled conditions, all of which are dependant on more investors sitting up and taking notice. With the different stages of development needed for drugs being expensive and lengthy, the cost will no doubt be high but there is no total figure on how much it will take to get MEAI out of labs into bars as of yet.

Finally, we asked Nutt if he had tried MEAI himself. “Of course I have!” he chuckled. “It’s a lot like alcohol; it’s relaxing and pleasant but it doesn’t make you want to drink more. I haven’t tried it with alcohol, but will do so once we’ve pinpointed a dosage that works.”

So how long could it be before we order Chaperon instead of Chardonnay? Concluded Nutt: “The bottom line is whoever puts money on the table determines whether or not this happens, but I’m very optimistic and excited to see how our research develops.”
