[Imperial have launched an anonymous survey to help to develop an Education and Student Strategy](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/educationoffice/strategy/students). The website consists of a questionnaire with all open text responses for students and staff to fill out with their thoughts on the education and student experience. The survey is behind a log in wall, but is going to be anonymous, unless students wish to be credited with their suggestions. The survey is open to all members of the College community and will be open until Tuesday 19 February. There will be two open meetings, which all students and staff can attend, at 13:00-14:00 Wednesday 6 February and 17:00-18:00 Thursday 14 February in the Pippard Lecture Theatre in Sherfield.

The survey is split up into four ‘strategic objectives’. Each one relates to the educational and student experience at Imperial. There are examples that are deemed useful from other institutions around the world and data from within College is provided next to the question. These is also a box at the bottom of the page for further suggestions, and students and staff can complete as much or as little as they wish to. There is also a hashtag #impcoled for people to share their ideas via Twitter.

Championing the survey is the [Pro-Rector (Education) Debra Humphris](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/3126/a-long-term-strategist/), who will be sorting through the responses to produce a ‘green paper’, which will be further streamlined into a ‘white paper’. This will be the document that contains the Education and Student Strategy, and will be taken to the relevant boards (Management Board and College Council) for review and to start putting it into practice. This white paper will be the implementation plan, which will be taken to the Management Board for consideration in June of this year. Speaking of the survey, Humphris said: “Every cohort of Imperial students leaves an imprint on the College. We hope part of the current generation’s legacy will be to help shape the experience of their successors, by sharing their views and opinions with us in this process.”

[Paul Beaumont, Union President](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/your-union/your-representatives/sabbatical-officers/paul-beaumont), urged students to fill out the survey by saying that “nothing is more powerful in effecting change than a huge mandate. This mandate can only be achieved by all fifteen thousand students collectively voicing ideas, opinions and suggestions: please use this chance to have your say in the future of the College.” He also stressed that this is “the opportunity for current students and staff alike to mould the education strategy for the next few years directly.” Beaumont stated: “The College’s education strategy is a key part in the academic mission as a whole.

Imperial College Union, sabbaticals and student representatives are actively feeding into this process through the Union’s representation structure”.

The President & Rector, [Sir Keith O’Nions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_O'Nions), said of the survey: “Between now and Tuesday 19 February we are asking staff, students and alumni to take part in our Education and Student Strategy Consultation, and contribute ideas and opinions about fundamental aspects of education at Imperial, capturing what we already achieve and how we can improve”. Sir Keith called the views given “crucial”, and said that it has “been essential to adapt Imperial’s educational approaches to keep pace”. Sir Keith went on to say: “In an era in which we compete with many other world-class institutions to recruit the brightest and the best, we need to consider what distinguishes Imperial’s offer to students. We should be clear on how we intend to stretch and nourish students and equip them for their future careers.”

The President & Rector ended with a call for all to fill out the survey: “Our students deserve the very best from Imperial – I hope you will take this opportunity to shape the education and experiences we offer them.”
