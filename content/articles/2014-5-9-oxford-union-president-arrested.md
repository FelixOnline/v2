According to the Tab Oxford, this week the Oxford Union President Ben Sullivan was arrested by Police and questioned concerning allegations over an incident of rape and another of attempted rape.

Sullivan was woken up by police at 7.10 AM on Wednesday morning and was released on bail until June 18.

This news follows recent turmoil in Oxford’s debating Union, which has led to the resignation of two officers under Sullivan’s command after Sullivan attempt to use the society’s money to stop the press printing a story about his membership of an elite Christ Church College drinking club.

The allegations, which were later covered by the Times, accused Sullivan of belonging to the Banter Squadron, an “informal” elite drinking society. Sullivan attempted to use £1,200 of Union members’ money to stop the press, and later was forced to admit membership after this attempt failed and the press refused to accept information about blackmail incidents involving other members of the Oxford Union.

In a statement to the press, Sullivan later reverted his story, claiming “I said I was not aware of what the ‘Banter Squadron’ was and that I had never been a ‘member’ because the idea that the ‘Banter Squadron’ is a formal organisation is frankly ridiculous.

The phrase is an ironic term that has sometimes been used to ­refer to our group of friends. I apologise for not being more clear ­originally.”
