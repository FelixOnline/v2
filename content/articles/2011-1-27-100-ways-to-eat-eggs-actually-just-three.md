Apparently eggs are the ultimate fast food. Some of you may already know this. In fact I know one guy who eats scrambled eggs nearly everyday. Good effort, Steve!

Anyway, the fact is they are high in protein, low in fat and carbohydrates and therefore very good for you! Here are three simple recipes that will get even the worst cooks of you making eggs like a pro.

__Poached egg__

The simplest of the eggs in my opinion, all you need here is a fresh egg, some vinegar and a little bit of hot water.

Boil some water and pour about 3- 4cm into a pan and heat until just boiled.

Make sure to add a good glug of vinegar – this is very, very important!

Now add your eggs and turn the heat right down.

Cook to your preference. If you like it runny, it will take about 2-3 minutes and the top of the egg should have a pinkish tinge. Enjoy!

__Scrambled egg__

Probably the quickest of the lot, all you need here is a decent non-stick (ish) pan, a couple of good eggs, some butter and some salt and pepper.

Melt a blob of butter into a hot pan. Whisk 2-3 eggs in a bowl and add a decent sprinkle of salt and pepper.

Pour the egg into pan. The pan should be hot enough so that the egg cooks straight away so make sure you scramble it! The cooking process should take less than two minutes.

__Alpine egg__

You might not have heard of these beauties but a good alpine egg can be amazing. What you need here is an egg, some butter, some grated cheese and a ramekin. If you don’t have this, just a normal coffee cup will do.

Butter the ramekin or cup and put half the cheese on the bottom.

Crack the egg on top the cheese then carefully sprinkle the rest of the cheese so the egg is totally covered. Add a fair amount of salt and pepper.

You can add chives, spring onion or finely chopped onion for extra flavour.

Have your oven on gas 5 or 190°C and whack in the ramekin for about 10 minutes max. If you’re using the coffee cup put it in the microwave instead for about 2-3 minutes.

I suggest using the cup in the microwave method purely for speed.

Out of all the recipes I strongly recommend this one. This is my personal favourite, its quick, easy and if you add a bit of salad (yeah, right) or have it with some bread it can be a decent meal.

So there you have it. Four ways to use those eggs in your flatmate’s fridge.

Enjoy.
