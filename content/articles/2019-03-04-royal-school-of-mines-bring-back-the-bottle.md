Following last year’s away loss to CSM, the stage was set for the RSM rugby boys to put in a huge performance. With the glorious sunshine in the hands of RSM, the team looked strong from the off. 

RSM kicked off well while CSM were being dazzled by the Harlington sun. A knock-on from kick off allowed RSM to start the game strong during the CSM half. A solid, well-worked set piece move from the backs of RSM, followed by some dominant carries from the forward pack, set the tone of the first half. The RSM boys consistently broke the game line, and the backs committed CSM to some hard lines - and out the back plays. 

After a solid 10 minutes in the CSM half, a try was deservedly scored by RSM. Parker leaped over the line to take the lead to 5-0, with a successful conversion from the RSM fly-half, Kirrane, took the score to 7-0. Short exits from the CSM half-backs allowed for RSM to continue their plays in the CSM half. The success of RSM’s structured play lead to a strong carry from Hallett, resulting in another RSM try out near the touch line. The two sides then had the chance to regroup at half time with a score of 12-0. 

The game then took a turn at the start of the second half. CSM kickedoff, the ball was deep into the RSM twenty-two. As RSM missed a chance to exit and after conceding two penalties on their own try line, CSM took their chance and worked their way over the line. An unsuccessful conversion took the score to 12-5. 

RSM then took their foot slightly off the pedal, giving way for some potential CSM plays to be made. Although, solid commitment from both defensive lines allowed for play to be made around the half way mark of the pitch. RSM gained momentum and CSM began to fatigue, CSM conceded a penalty within their own twenty-two. RSM made the decision to kick for the sticks, and successfully so, took them up to a 10 point lead. This 10 point deficit deflated the away team and finally the game was put to an end, giving RSM the win with a score of 15-5, and the bottle being returned home.
