If you ever wondered how giant LEGO models are made, Warren Elsmore’s book Brick City shows you how! The book travels the world in different LEGO models, starting in San Francisco and ending in Japan, showing recognisable landmarks built from LEGO along the way. One of the biggest models is Westminster Abbey, built from 180,000 bricks and filled with hundreds of minifigures. Created in 2011 for the Royal Wedding, it includes working clocks and stained glass windows. Other models include a 120,000 piece St. Pancras station with an oyster bar and working Eurostar trains.

The author, Warren Elsmore, will be giving a guest lecture in Huxley 311 on Tuesday at 6:30pm for LEGOSoc. He will be explaining how to translate these existing building into giant LEGO models. Warren is a professional LEGO builder with years of experience. He’s built a huge number of impressive models and displayed them all over the world. He’s also the president and conference organiser of Brickish, the UK’s official LEGO user group.
