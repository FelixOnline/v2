This recipe was taken from the book _Vegan Pie In The Sky_ by Isa Chandra Moskowitz.

The great thing about this recipe is that you use olive oil instead of butter and this makes your apple pie much healthier. The olive oil makes the crust extremely flaky and you cannot taste it! This recipe makes a 9 inch pie.

__For the crust:__
 – 2.5 cups all purpose flour
 – 3⁄4 tsp salt
 – 2⁄3 cup olive oil
 – 4-8 tbsp ice water
 – 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar

__For the filling:__
 – 6 cups Granny Smith Apples cut in slices
 – 1⁄3 cup brown sugar
 – 1⁄2 cup white sugar
 – 1 teaspoon cinnamon
 – 1⁄2 teaspoon ground ginger
 – 1⁄8 teaspoon ground cloves
 – 3 tablespoons all purpose flour
 – Pinch of salt

__For the topping:__
 – 1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
 – 2 tablespoons sugar
 – 2 tablespoons soy milk or any milk of your choice

One hour before making the crust place the olive oil in the refrigerator until it becomes like a sorbet. In a mixing bowl combine the flour with the olive oil and the salt. Then add the ice water and vinegar slowly until you can shape the dough into a ball. Do not overmix.

Divide the ball into two equal discs and place each one of them between two sheets of wax paper. Roll each disc into a circle.

Preheat your oven at 218°C. Fit half the pie dough into a 9-inch pie pan. In a bowl combine all the filling ingredients and add them to the prepared pie shell. Place on top the rest of the dough and brush it with the milk.

Then sprinkle with the cinnamon and sugar. Bake the pie for 25 minutes at 218°C and then lower the heat and bake for another half an hour.

Let it cool before serving.
