Something big went down this weekend: 25 of Imperial Snowsports’ finest and loosest made the annual pilgrimage to BUDS, a massive national snowsports competition just outside Edinburgh. To put it simply, it was seriously incredible.

Starting and ending with a charming coach trip with our snow–loving buddies from Middlesex, Kings and Queen Mary, the weekend was truly huge. Each day, following some of the best nights of our entire lives with 2,000 other snowsports students from all over the UK, we’d smash a Wetherspoons fry-up then head off to the dry slope to cheer on our champions.
 The highlight was ERASMUS legend Tristan de Kerchove progressing to the freestyle semi finals as he threw some unreal tricks, including the infamous ‘Cork 7’. This is an unbelievable achievement considering it was on the dry slope, a surface he is completely    unfamiliar with. Kerchove has well and truly cemented IC’s place on the university    snowsports map and as our Hero.

Naturally, amongst the aforementioned huge nights was the BUDS ball. Donning our sexiest suits, all 2,000 hit up one of Edinburgh’s finest dining establishments to enjoy some mountain raclette and cheese cake. This, of course, descended into yet another unforgettable night to round off what will go down in history as one of ICSC’s greatest weekends.
 It was an all round great weekend watching the best racers and freestylers from all over the country smashing their competitions in the day, and then taking to Edinburgh at night to celebrate.

Thank you to everyone who came for a lovely game of BUDS. To everyone else, you can still get in on the fun, we’ve got spaces left on our Christmas ski trip. This year we’re heading to the world renowned Val Thorens in the French Alps from the 16th to the 24th  of December for the low base price of £399. If you want to get involved head over to our Facebook page or email ski@ic.ac.uk.
