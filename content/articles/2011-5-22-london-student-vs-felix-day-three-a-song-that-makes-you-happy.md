     Oooh that's a good recommendation, I can't think of anything more appropriate,Like it! I also like Marathon by Tennis for a summer tune :) ,summerrrrr :),WOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.,Quite a tune... I can never go past Happiness by Goldfrapp to make me happy. The glorious thing is that it's about a cult which steals people's money. <br> <br>Go with Someone Great by LCD Soundsystem for a song to make me sad?

The reaction when I play someone this [Star Slinger](http://www.starslinger.net/home.html) song is always the same: "Holy shit that's awesome!" they say in not so many words. The song (and its video) makes me happy for two reasons:

1. It's full of summery cheer and makes you want to jump out of bed and run around in a field (accompanied by lots of lens glare and weird psychedelic patterns).

2. It's a gateway drug to a whole lot of other Star Slinger tunes – like [this Gold Panda remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jwoOODS0TQ)
