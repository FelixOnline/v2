Ah, what a powerful feeling!

I manipulate Red Man and Green.

My thumbs are in full control,

I order leaps, dashes and sprints across the screen.

--------

I am the virtual boss,

Haha! I click at buttons A and B,

Every problem you could ever think of, I can solve,

Brave is what I am, staring into the face of adversity.

--------

Princess Peach needs rescuing?

Fear not, I am here!

Relax.

I have the ability, the agility,

Pumped with self-esteem.

--------

Impossibility?

Impossible!

--------

I defy the laws of physics,

Yes, I double jump my way through World Six,

With my artillery; fire flowers,

And my sidekick, Luigi.

--------

Here comes my ‘Mario-mobile’,

He’s my dinosaur. You can call him Yoshi.

--------

Everything is under control.

Literally.

Just another day in the office,

Muscles grow very quickly.

No need to strain myself in a weight room,

Body mass times two after eating my favorite Mushroom.

--------

Hardcore gaming. Amazing.

--------

Sadly, back to reality, a light flashes red and yellow.

A handheld system cries for life.

Oh no! Nintendo!

Desperation is signified.

--------

Please, a moment of silence,

The battery of my GameBoy... has just died.
