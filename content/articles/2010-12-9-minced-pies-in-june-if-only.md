What’s the point in Christmas?

Before you start, I should make it clear I don’t have a personal grudge – or Grinch – against the festive season. Far from it – this whole month fills me with a child-like joy that eagerly effervesces with each opened advent calendar door. It would take strong persuasion to convince me not to live off mince pies and mulled wine for the rest of my life.

But, much as I love Christmas, I can’t see a purpose for it. Oh, of course, the Christians (of which I am one) have their reasons, and the pagans before them. But in this secular age, why do we celebrate Christmas?

Given the amount of time, effort and money most people put into this season, it is strange that the whole thing should feel so...empty. After an overenthusiastic haircut for King Charles I, Oliver Cromwell sought to ban Christmas. He wanted religion without the party. These days, people seem to want the party without religion. I’m not saying that to have a meaningful Christmas, you have to trudge to church for hours, I just find it hard to understand why people want to celebrate...nothing.

However, even if Christmas in this modern age is pointless, we should still strive to preserve it and make it special. In a perfect universe, everything would have its place and nothing would exist without reason. But this is not our reality – we still have Piers Morgan, after all. I prefer it when things have a reason, but if they don’t, that doesn’t mean they can’t be good.

People often talk about the “Christmas spirit,” some kind of benevolent magic in the air which facilitates serendipity at a far higher frequency than normal. I guess it’s inevitable; with so much thought about other people’s presents, parties, and placemats, some of that focus is bound to spill over into considering their wellbeing as well.

People seem to be more generous at this time of the year and whatever the reason, this is something that should be celebrated.

However, I do have one issue with this. People say they enjoy Christmas because it allows them to spend time with their families (Likewise, they also hate it for the same reason). What’s stopping them the rest of the year? If it only takes bright lights and tinsel to engender a sense of magnanimity in us, why don’t we celebrate Christmas the whole year round?

It would give me the excuse I need to drink mulled wine in March.

Merry Christmas to all of you...or winter Solstice, or whatever name you’re giving to your celebrations. Regardless, have a most festive season and a happy new year!
