A review into the wardening system has recommended reducing the number of sub-wardens by around 15%. The reductions, which will occur through the normal turnover of contracts, are aimed at rebalancing the College’s welfare provision towards counselling and disability services.

The recommendations will see a total of nine subwarden posts being removed from Eastside, Southside, Orient House, Holbein Willis Jackson, and Fisher Hall. The wardening review ran from May 2010 to March 2011 and on comparing Imperial’s wardening provision with other universities found that the ratio of wardening staff to students at Imperial was significantly higher than at comparable institutions (1:30 at Imperial vs. 1:84 at UCL, on average).

It was decided that halls with a ratio of 1:31 or less would have a reduction of one subwarden beginning in 2011/2012, with the caveat that no hall should have less than four wardening staff. The reduction will see the average ratio at Imperial rise to 1:34.

The recommendations note that ‘the College’s very favourable Wardening ratios make an important contribution to the halls system’ but argues that ‘some economies in the budget are necessary’ due to the current financial climate. The wardening system currently takes up around 50% of the College’s welfare budget.

In a [report to Union Council](http://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/data/files/dpw-council-report-23rd-may-3693.pdf) last week, Deputy President (Welfare) Charlotte Ivison said that the reductions were an “economic measure” and that “no subwardens will have to leave their post prematurely”. Some sub-wardens may have to move hall as a result of the reductions.

The Dean of Students Denis Wright, who chaired the Review Panel, did not respond to a request for comment.
