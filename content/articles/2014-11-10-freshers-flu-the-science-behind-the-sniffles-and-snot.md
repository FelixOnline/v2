Freshers’ Week for most is a time full of new experiences, stepping out of your usual comfort zone and meeting more new people than you could hope to remember. There are very few instances in your life that you will speak to as many strangers in such a short period of time, turning awkward conversations into friendships and introducing yourself so many times that you start to wonder who you are anymore. So with your luggage unpacked and the excitement building, you hold many expectations for the week to come. However, the anticipated roller-coaster adventure that is your first few weeks at University is also likely to bring with it Freshers’ Flu.

You have probably heard it described as nothing more than a glorified hangover. Don’t be fooled. Freshers’ flu is real, and there is a 90%chance you will get it. Despite its name, Freshers’ Flu is a blanket term to describe a bad cold rather than flu itself; symptoms range from person to person but usually include a beautiful mix of coughing, sneezing, headaches and a temperature.

So what causes this onslaught of bed-ridden freshers? During the first few weeks of university you meet hundreds of new people from across the globe. As good as your immune system is, after being bombarded with such a vast collection of foreign invading pathogens, it is more than likely to encounter one you are not already immune to.

On top of this, moving away from home and taking those first steps to independence alongside so many strangers can put a lot of stress on your body and mind. Not to mention the binge drinking, fast-food eating and general unruly behaviour!

If you get struck down, my advice is to rest – this may be the last genuine excuse to miss a lecture, so enjoy it and let your body adjust to the new environment. Don’t feel you need to arm yourself with facemasks and an NBC suit, instead, if you feel unwell perhaps skip the partying and boogying for one night.

A sore throat and headache are nothing you can’t handle after some fresh lemon and honey tea alongside a good night’s sleep. Vitamin C tablets also work a treat – Berocca tablets are my personal favourite cold-busting cure, and great for hangovers too! Don’t forget to register with Imperial Healthcare Centre and make a visit if you feel your symptoms persist.

It’s common year on year for lecture halls and library study rooms alike to bear the ultimate burden of Freshers’ Flu: collective coughing. However you will find that as the term progresses, the noise will quieten down, the germs will stop spreading and you can proceed once more to hear your lecturer instead of the moans and groans of the invalids around you. Just beware for next year, when the new Freshers arrive!
