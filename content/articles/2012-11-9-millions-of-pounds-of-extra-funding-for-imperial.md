     Great for Imperial, not that they need the money. <br> <br>It's a shame that organisations like HEFCE are disproportionately supportive of the leading Russell Group universities - they tend to already be in favourable financial situations, and already have the infrastructure in place to produce top class research outputs, or "knowledge exchange" as HEFCE so affectionately describes it. <br> <br>Should HEFCE not do more for the neglected universities? They are plagued with cuts, restructuring and redundancies, so may lack the facilities but otherwise have the ability to "stimulate economic growth through research".

Imperial are to beone of twelve universities that are going to benefit from £6m of funding from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE).

In a speech at the UUK conference, David Willetts, Mnister for Universities and Science, announced that HEFCE will give the highest performing universities in knowledge exchange an additional £6m. Imperial was amongst the twelve universities that will be allocated the funding. The aim of the extra funding, as stated on the HEFCE website, is to “stimulate economic growth through research commercialisation activities”.

Imperial was one of the highest performing universities in the area of knowledge exchange.
