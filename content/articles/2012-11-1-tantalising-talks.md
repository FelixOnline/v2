As term really kicks off and we all start getting stuck in our routine, ICDC are coming at you with more projects and talks than you can shake multiple sticks at to get into a creative state of mind.

Fresh from having the heads of [Genesis bikes ](http://www.genesisbikes.co.uk/)judging and aiding our successful last project looking into cycling and the city of London, we found ideas ranging from simple effective gadgets to reorganising traffic systems, this really showed how ICDC is a brilliant platform for us to use our technical expertise within the design realm allowing quick development time and detailed concepts to emerge in just under 4 hours! However as you all must know by now, we don’t just have workshops, we also had Andrew Waugh coming to talk to us about his architecture firm ‘[Waugh Thistleton](http://www.waughthistleton.com/)’ architects. In the talk we were given some insight into how Andrew, instead of entering into a large corporate entity, built up his own firm doing what he wanted to do from the very beginning. He has just finished building the world’s largest timber residential structure in Shoreditch and is now leading the way for cheap and green architecture across the globe.

We now look onto the coming weeks and we have just launched our second project ‘Interactive City’ which has been planned in collusion with [Andrew Shoben](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Shoben) (TEDX Speaker and world’s only professor in public art, so no big deal..) who is behind [www.greyworld.org](http://greyworld.org/). Here we will be looking at how to engage citizens of the city through fun and inspiration to respect and enjoy their respective realms. For more information on our workshops be sure to check out our Facebook page (link below).

Whilst these workshops continue we will also be having a talk held by Imperial’s very own [Professor Peter Childs](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/p.childs), on the subject of future aircraft cabin design. With projections indicating an increase in mobility over the next few decades and annual flight departures expected to rise to over 16 billion by 2050 there is a demand for the aviation industry and associated stakeholders to consider new forms of aircraft and technology. This presentation will describe a collaboration between a large team of Innovation Design Engineering students from Imperial College London and the Royal College of Art and Airbus to explore and develop concepts for future aircraft.

The talk will be held at the Royal School of Mines room LT G20 on Thursday, 1 November 2012 from 18.00 until 19.00. Again make sure to check the event on Facebook where we can be found at: <http://www.facebook.com/ICDCollective>
