This week, Council agreed to change the name of the Deputy President (Clubs & Societies) and Deputy President (Finance & Services) roles to Deputy Presidents (Activities & Development) and (Activities & Finance) respectively.

This change is the result of a “Officer Trustee Role Review” that has been conducted by the current Sabbatical team after a similar role review last academic year.

Aside from the name change, the paper also made changes to the Union Bye-Laws so they more accurately reflect the roles and responsibilities of the Sabbatical Officers.

Over the last year there has been some reisistance to the name change.
