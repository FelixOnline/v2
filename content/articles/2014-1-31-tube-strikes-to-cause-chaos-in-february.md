Transport for London have announced that next week there will be disruption to underground travel. On Wednesday 5 February and Thursday 6 February walkouts are expected. Services will be affected from as early as 21.30hrs on February 4 so don’t get caught out.

Talks to avert the strikes are being held. However, TfL have devised a strategy to keep London moving should the industrial action go ahead.

Extra buses will be laid on, and ‘ambassadors’ will endeavour to keep Tube stations open, providing travel advice and information as necessary.

TfL advises that Tube services will finish early on Tuesday evening so customers are urged to complete their journey as early as possible. Tube services are expected to return to normal on Friday morning.
