Hollywood big-hitter and modern day renaissance man Will Smith [was to be found at Imperial’s very own Ethos Sports Centre](http://www.twitvid.com/DQHPJ) on Princes Gardens last Wednesday morning.

Smith was visiting the centre as part of a promotional tour for the upcoming film [_Men in Black III_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2r9AIfYcV8), but managed to eschew the usual promotional duties in favour of demonstrating his sporting prowess alongside some of Britain’s Olympic hopefuls from Team GB.

Also taking to the gym hall were GB Basketball captain Drew Sullivan, triple jumper Yamile Aldama, super heavyweight boxer Anthony Joshua and hurdler Perri Shakes-Drayton.

Engaging in a few shots of basketball, a leap over the hurdles and a quick bout, Smith entertained the assembled press with his disarming and still resolutely fresh athleticism.

A vast amount of secrecy surrounded the event, with knowledge of Smith’s arrival privy to only a select few, including Union President Scott Heath. Few were aware of the presence of the Fresh Prince until the event had concluded, with even Felix only discovering after the actor's departure.

The presence of Team GB marks the impending arrival of the Japanese Olympic Committee for the entirety of London 2012, who will be accommodated on the South Kensington Campus. The Switzerland Open Swimming and Triathlon team will also be staying at the South Kensington campus during the event and using the Ethos swimming pool for training purposes. Team GB will be also using the pool for training.
