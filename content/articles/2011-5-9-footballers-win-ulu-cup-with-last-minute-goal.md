The end of spring term saw the 1st XI clash with UCL in the ULU Cup Final. The two teams had been head and shoulders above the competition throughout the year, with Imperial denied the league title by a single point after suffering their only defeat of the season against UCL’s. This only strengthened Imperial’s resolve, and the squad went into the game in high spirits, and with a legion of fans to help them on their way.

Imperial suffered an early setback when centre-half Farag failed a late fitness test and was ruled out. Despite this Imperial began the game well, dominating the first 20 minutes with composed play. On the break however, UCL threatened, and with Hill picking up an early booking in the centre of the park – presumably for appearance’ sake, the back four could no longer rely on the usual degree of protection. After 25 minutes, Imperial paid the price for allowing a UCL forward a moment too long on the ball, as he threaded the ball behind the Imperial defence to his strike partner, who duly put his team ahead.
 Imperial were buoyed by the belief that they had the better of their opposition, and surged forward in an attempt to level the score before half time. They were rewarded handsomely when Benincasa played a delightful through ball to Eshun, who raced onto the pass and delicately lifted the ball over the UCL keeper’s head with remarkable calm.

Towards the start of the second half Imperial looked to lose some of their early impetus. This changed somewhat when Hill, forced off by injury, was replaced by Wilson – an inspired substitution which restored a good deal of composure and shape to the Imperial side. Both teams pressed on, but the two strongest defences in the league helped to keep the scores level until the 75th minute. Imperial were slightly overexposed at the back when UCL crafted a slick move – culminating in a headed goal for their striker.

Aware that time was running out, Imperial switched to an aggressive 3-4-3 position. The quality of the Imperial midfield began to show, and when Weedon played the industrious Robinson through on goal in the 86th minute, he took his chance beautifully – slotting home to level the scores at 2-2 and spark mayhem on the touchline. Imperial were in the ascendancy and, with the indescribable support of the fans behind them, dug deep to try and find a winner. Hearts were in mouths when Fryatt made a desperate goal line clearance, but Imperial pushed on.

Entering the 93rd minute of the match, when weary legs were all but resigned to extra time, Benincasa again played Eshun through on goal. All present held their breath as Eshun – 1st XI POTY, and with more than 50 Imperial goals under his belt, powered toward goal – but he made no mistake. Pandemonium ensued.

Imperial gathered themselves and saw out the last agonising seconds in good style, to cap a stunning comeback and take a 3-2 victory. Not even a misplaced trophy could dampen the enthusiasm of the Imperial contingent, who headed back to South Kensington as champions.
