Off the back of the Met office announcement on Monday that the climate is about to pass the one-degree threshold for global warming, I sat at my desk trying to write a coherent piece about the subject. As I typed away on my laptop, making notes from articles and reading up on the subject I asked myself – “what about the climate?” Everyone who is anyone with any real information knows climate change is happening so what more is there to write about? I lay my palms on the table and sigh– the research hadn’t given me the momentum I hoped for, and now I had hit the proverbial cul-de-sac. I thought about the issue, read most of this month’s issue of the National Geographic magazine, solely dedicated to climate change , and sunk further into my chair. To sum up climate change discussions in a nutshell: interesting statistics, the science which proves climate change is occurring, utilising renewable energy sources, climate change’s impact, and initiatives to combat this. I knew the facts, but I didn’t really have much to say. I once heard someone comment that people who don’t make good writers are those that didn’t have anything to say. So I reflected – what could I say?

I asked myself why I was sitting trying to write but not finding much inspiration. And the answer? I like writing, but I was forcing it. I realised that of all the things that I’ve tried to do, writing has come most easily – it has always been a pleasure. It’s my experience with writing that I would like to share.
> Repression is the worst thing anyone can do
In this day and age where we’re so caught up in our own lives, under the stress of deadlines, of work, jobs, job applications and constantly being plugged into our phones, it is important to find time for yourself. We’ve all been moulded to be cogs in the ‘system’ and arguably have had some of our creativity beaten out of us in the process.

But it’s creativity and imagination, and the effort to keep it alive that is the struggle. I would recommend writing for the very reason that it is a means to keep your imagination alive. It is a great stress reliever, where you’re able to take what’s on your chest, place it on paper and rid yourself of your burdens. In our lives it’s important to have coping mechanisms, but more importantly mechanisms to live sustainably and satisfactorily. Words are symbols which express our thoughts and feelings and there is a certain beauty in being able to say something and for people to know exactly what you mean. Sometimes these words help you understand what your thoughts when thinking about a subject or problem. Putting things down on paper can help you order your mind. It is also an attempt to give expression to thoughts and feelings you know, but can’t quite convey even to yourself. From my anecdotal experience, with regards to many people’s feelings or problems, it is being able to express them that legitimises them. Before , its expression it is simply a passing, unimportant thought, but when you hear or read it expressed you realise you had a legitimate point. Or you realise that you actually have a problem which needs to be dealt with.

We live in a time where depression is a big issue. Pressures at university can drive us up the wall. Having to cram information, trying to understand complex mathematics from PowerPoint slides, pressures of exams, friends and that is just within our own immediate life, let alone the evil and sadness caused by poverty, hunger, war, and racism among many other things. A lot of times we need a release in just talking about things but for one reason or another we can’t. Repression is the worst thing anyone can do because the frustration builds up. Seek help, but for your deepest secrets and thoughts which you’re not ready to reveal, writing it on paper can act as a stepping stone to getting professional help and talking about it. Having written it down, this can have the effect of helping you articulate your issue better. Sometimes you may think people won’t take you seriously, but if you can explain your situation and feelings better it will help. At other times when you have an issue you know there is something wrong because you feel stressed or demotivated, but you crucially do not accept that something is wrong because you cannot express it. Writing can help in its expression and thus self-realisation of the issue. It’s certainly helped me to get things straight in my head, identify the source of issues and be able to articulate them correctly.

So I would recommend that you find a hobby, release or outlet . It may be sport, reading, arts and crafts, or something else entirely. But if you haven’t found one yet, or want to try something new, pick up a pen and maybe you’ll find writing is what you had been looking for the whole time.
