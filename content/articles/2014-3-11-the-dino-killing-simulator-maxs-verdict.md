In games, I like shooting things. My targets tend to include Zombies, terrorists, counter-terrorist and now, due to an incredibly cheap game, dinosaurs. Yes, I am talking about Orion’s Dino horde. After seeing it for less than a quid on Steam, I was quite tempted to buy it and give it a go. Initially, after reading reviews on different gaming websites I was put off by the negative ratings. However, my fellow games editor Calum, who was also as intrigued by me by this game, convinced me to get it. So I did.

That evening I tried Dino horde for the first time, and boy was I disappointed. To be honest, I had no clue what was going on, I ran out of ammo and generally didn’t know what was going on. I mean, yeah it was fun to take down dinosaurs, but it got boring real fast. I stopped playing, and sighed, thinking I had just wasted a pound (not a lot to be honest, but still something y’know). Come Friday, I completely changed my mind.

After handing in a relatively nasty piece of coursework, Calum once again convinced me to give Dino Horde a try. This time I was not disappointed. Playing with friends in the room completely changed the dynamic of the game. Whereas previously I had no clue what was going on, this time I could actually ask if I didn’t understand anything. I played as the heavy-duty assault class, whose accessory is a jetpack. After getting all the upgrades, including double ammo, faster fire rate etc. I felt like I was pretty much the king of the world! I was just mowing down the beasts, Rambo style! Furthermore, being able to actually shout at my teammates, yelling for help or just generally laughing at the epicness was super fun.

All in all, for 1 pound I did not have much to lose, and thus the game is absolutely worth it. For it’s current price of about £10, I would be a bit more careful. The most important thing that makes this game fun is if you got a good bunch of friends who all play this game. This game is just so much more epic if you have a good group of people to play with. I mean, c’mon I used my jetpack to fly up and punch a pterodactyl in the face, killing it in the process, how much more epic can it be?
