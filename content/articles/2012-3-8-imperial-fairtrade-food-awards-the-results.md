__Second Place: Jordan Purvis__ and __Alison Lee__ took the second spot with their __Coffee and Walnut Cake__! For a little more inspiration, the prize takes the form of book Leon: Ingredients and Recipes

_Ingredients_
 For the cake:
 50g walnut pieces
 225g Fairtrade light brown sugar
 225g soft unsalted butter
 200g plain flour
 6 teaspoons Fairtrade instant espresso powder
 1 teaspoon of Fairtrade cinnamon
 2 1⁄2 teaspoons baking powder
 1⁄2 teaspoons bicarbonate of soda
 4 eggs
 2 x 15ml tablespoons milk
 For the espresso buttercream frosting:
 350g Fairtrade icing sugar
 175g soft unsalted butter
 2 1⁄2 teaspoons instant espresso powder, dissolved in 15ml of boiling water
 Others:
 25 g walnut halves, or enough to decorate 20 cm cake tin

_Method_
 Preheat the oven to 180 Degrees Celsius/ gas mark 4. Bash walnuts to a rubbly powder (leaving little bits and pieces will be fine) with a rolling pin and mix with the rest of the dry ingredients.
 Cream the butter and sugar together, and beat in the dry ingredients and eggs alternately.
 Finally, add in the milk slowly while constantly beating the mixture. The mixture should give a smooth consistency (add less or more milk depending on this).
 Pour the cake mixture into the baking tin and bake in the oven for roughly 30 minutes, or until the sponge has turned brown or feels springy to touch. A sharp knife can be used to pierce the cake layer to check whether the baking is done.
 After baking, leave the cake to cool on a wire rack.
 Start making the buttercream frosting by boiling some water in a small saucepan and adding the espresso powder.
 Sieve the icing sugar in a bowl and beat in the butter with a wooden spoon. Add in the hot coffee liquid mixture slowly and mix well.
 Once the cake has cooled down enough, spread the espresso buttercream frosting on top of the cake and decorate with walnuts and some cinnamon powder.

__Third Place: __The final main competition winner, __Faye Thomsit__, fired up the fruits and created a __Foxy Fairtrade Sunshine Soufflé__, winning a copy of Just Desserts: 50 sweet surprises using Fairtrade ingredients

Serves 2, suitable for vegetarians, coeliacs and those who are dairy intolerant.

_You will need: _
 One Plate
 Two Ramekins (or an old Gü pot, good for reuse)
 A Saucepan or Microwavable bowl
 Oven set to 150 Degrees Celsius

_Ingredients_
 1 Papaya/pawpaw cut into cubes
 1 Mango cut into slices
 1 Banana Fairtrade, sliced diagonally
 Dried ribbon cut coconut (optional)
 ½ Juiced Lime
 1 tsp Traidcraft Wild Blossom Fair Trade Honey
 Oil
 30g Tesco Finest Fairtrade Organic 70% Plain Chocolate
 12g Tate & Lyle Fair trade Gran Sugar 1kg
 Free Range Egg separated
 (or one white, to ½ yolk if scaling up)

_Method_
 For the Soufflé grease the ramekin with oil, then finely grate the chocolate into the ramekin and roll it round the sides.
 Place 25g of dark chocolate in container in warm/simmering water (make sure the container does not touch the bottom of the saucepan, or the chocolate will burn), alternatively melt the chocolate in the microwave, using short bursts, checking and stirring regularly.
 Whisk the egg yolk to firm peak (bit stronger than soft), then whisk the yolk and the sugar together. Drizzle the melted chocolate into the yolk mixture. Add the whites bit by bit into the yolk and chocolate mixture; then fold the whites in gently, without losing any air.
 Spoon the mixture into the ramekin and cook for 25 minutes.
 Do not open the oven door during this time, as this will cause the Soufflé to collapse.
 Dressing the plate; Use the spare ramekin to mark the centre of the plate; then lay the papaya cubes round the ramekin in a circle. Next lay the mango slices out like rays of the sun, spreading from the papaya. Between each piece of mango, place a round of banana, then sprinkle on the coconut if desired.
 Place the honey and lime in the saucepan, 5 minutes before the soufflé is cooked, warming into a dressing, and drizzle over the fruit salad. Take the soufflé from the oven, place on plate, serve immediately.

Enjoy with a partner or a friend.
