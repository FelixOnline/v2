Imperial’s 2nd team made the long journey to Kent to play Christchurch Canterbury, looking to rectify last week’s game which by all rights should have been won.

Imperial clearly coped better with the delayed start as they had the upper hand in the early exchanges, which resulted in Tom Mavin making an inspired run involving steps and fends going over to score a seven pointer.

This seemed to fire up the opposition and their large hoard of supporters thus allowing them to gain some front football, using their big runners unimaginatively yet effectively. A combination of this and some poor defending from Imperial allowed Christchurch into the lead to with two tries.

Christchurch kept the pressure on but improved defence from Imperial limited them to a couple of long range penalty efforts which they were unable to convert. Eventually Imperial, with Tom Mavin setting the example, switched on again and worked their way up the field and after some nice back interplay Ruairi Dunne was able to score in the corner.

This was backed up by a nice conversion by Anthony Cheuk to put Imperial back in the lead just before half time. The second half was not quite as entertaining as the first, with neither side really able to gain a foot hold.

A lack of match practice showed for Imperial as we spent vast amounts of the half trying to play rugby in our own red zone. Ultimately this cost us as Christchurch were able to capitalise on an Imperial mistake and score again.

Imperial tried to fight back but unfortunately time was against them and the match ended in a 17-14 defeat.
