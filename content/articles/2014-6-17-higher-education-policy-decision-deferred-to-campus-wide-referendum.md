The Union’s Higher Education policy will go to a referendum later this year, after Union Council felt unable to make a decision without further consultation. Students will have the opportunity to choose from three funding models: free education, graduate tax and the current tuition fee loan system.

Arguments for each funding model were proposed by Andrew Tranter (free education), Marissa Lewis (graduate tax) and Alex Savell (tuition fee loans). Students will get to choose one of the funding models to be the Union’s Higher Education policy in the next academic year.

The Higher Education funding model affects who pays and when, which can impact accessibility and quality of the student experience.

“There's a massive lack of democracy in our Union, which has previously resulted in small committees of bureaucrats making important decisions,” says Andrew Tranter, who proposed the motion to open the decsion up to a referendum.

“I'm glad that Council decided to finally ask the membership what they think.”

Union Deputy President (Education) Nat Kemptston said, “It’s great to see that so many students have opinions on how Higher Education funding should work.”

Planning is already underway for the Referendum in October, and I am excited to see what students decide Imperial College Union’s stance should be the issue.”

The NUS recently passed a free education motion during the national conference in April.
