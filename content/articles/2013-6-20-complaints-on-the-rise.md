 - Anon If Labour manages to successfully implement policy and thats the big if given past performance and the attitudes of their coalition partners then I dont expect National to roll it back  Their position has always been about avoiding the political cost to themselves and maximising it for Labour than anything else  And I think ACT will be the same Dunne even more soInsider Treasury seems to be deliberately underestimating the cost of credits  The level of emissions depends on what assumptions you make especially around the effects of policy at least the current batch are a little more transparent in what we should expectAs for overhyping our credit previous governments seem to have made a genuine error in calculating our baseline which led them all to believe that we would be in credit Labour can hardly be faulted for using the numbers MfEs experts gave them in 2001  2002  Their policy was significantly weaker than necessary as a result but it was based on the information they

[Figures](http://oiahe.org.uk/news-and-media/news-and-press-releases.aspx) from the official watchdog, the[ Office of the Independent Adjudicato](http://oiahe.org.uk/news-and-media/news-and-press-releases.aspx)r (OIA), show that complaints by students at universities in England and Wales have reached an all time high.  
 In 2012 there were 2012 complaints against universities, compared to 1605 the year before. Of the complaints, about 4% were deemed to be justified, 6% settled and 8% unjustified. 59% were declared to be unjustified. In total, universities paid £189,892 in compensation to students.  
 With regards to the nature of complaints: most (69%) were for academic status. This however means that 31% were for other complaints. Rob Behrens, OIA Chief Executive, stressed that these complaints are most likely not from the fee rise and that the impact of the £9000 fees will be seen later. He said: “We haven’t seen the full impact of the fee increase yet, because most complaints are from third year students and the fees do not apply to them yet.”
