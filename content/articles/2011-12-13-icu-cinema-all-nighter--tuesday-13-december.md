It’s that time of year again, when it is so brutally cold outside that finding a good night out where it’s socially acceptable to stay wrapped up in blankets is the stuff of dreams. Fortunately, it is also the time when [iCU Cinema](http://union.ic.ac.uk/arts/cinema/) brings us the Winter All-Nighter – the first all-nighter of the academic year, and a fantastic opportunity to catch all the films you might have missed over the last few months for only a tenner.
 iCU Cinema will be featuring the following six films, back-to-back, from 6pm on Tuesday 13 December, to 7:30am the next day – the ultimate test for the true cinema fan:

__Johnny English Reborn__ (6pm)
 The sequel heralds the return of Rowan Atkinson – possibly one of the most popular comic actors – in the titular role. Parodying the ever-ridiculous British spy genre, this is a welcome reminder of Atkinson’s irreplaceable talent for slapstick in this reprisal.

__Drive__ (8:15pm)
 In this crime drama, Ryan Gosling stars as a stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver in the dark LA underworld. The film, also starring Golsing’s impressive costars Carey Mulligan, Albert Brooks and Christina Hendricks, received rave reviews and the Best Director award at Cannes 2011. A must-see.

__Real Steel__ (10:30pm)
 Hugh Jackman leads in this sci-fi story of robot-boxing, playing a former boxer who, along with his young son, builds up a junkyard robot to battle the slick cyborgs that dominate the world of robot boxing. A classic underdog story, this film is a straight-up action film for the purpose of pure entertainment.

__Paul__ (1:15am)
 The latest from the unshakable duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, Paul is the story of two comic book nerd friends who encounter Paul – an off-beat alien (voiced by Seth Rogen) on their roadtrip. What follows combines the best parts of today’s British and American comedy genres, with Rogen being the perfect addition to Pegg and Frost’s team. Expect perfect comedy, together with endless sci-fi references.

__Contagion__ (3:30am)
 The serious feature of the evening, Contagion boasts an impressive cast includig Matt Damon, Kate Winslet and Gwyneth Paltrow. Capably directed by Steven Soderbergh, this modern-day thriller follows the progression of a deadly virus as it sweeps the world. An tense, impeccably-acted and fast-paced thriller.

__Troll Hunter__ (5:45am)
 And now, what better film to end the All-Nighter and send you off to lectures than this Norwegian mockumentary that follows a group of students who find themselves tracking a giant, violent troll through the woods. Critically acclaimed for its originality and flair, this film is fantastic example of how low-budget films can produce some remarkable results.

There is really is no good reason to miss this line-up. Tickets can be bought in advance for £10 from [www.icucinema.co.uk](http://www.icucinema.co.uk) or for £12 on the door. For those who cannot handle the full night of films, individual tickets can be bought for £3 each. Food and drinks are available all night, and full details can be found online.
