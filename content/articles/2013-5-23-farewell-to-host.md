I still cherish the memory of the first meeting of the IC Heads of Departments I attended – it was both educational and amusing.. Having received the invitation, my predecessor immediately tried to dissuade me from accepting it; nobody expected the Librarian to discuss College business, shamefully I would be the odd one out among the Heads.

Naturally, I immediately decided to go, taking the risk to be the odd one out, not on account of being the Librarian but being the only woman on the list of participants. The Rector, Eric Ash, was the first person to realize this, valiantly rising to the challenge: after rapping his gavel and emitting a stentorian cry: “Gentlemen”, he looked at me and added “and Magda”. The discussion included, as almost always, the financial prospects of the College; how much income the departments were expected to earn, and how the departments which did not bring in sufficient money would be supported. The Library was always a special case because of the disproportionately high cost of scientific journals, but everyone around the table agreed that journals were the life-blood of research and that their subscription must continue.

We also debated the position of HOST (History of Science and Technology), the relatively modest cost of maintaining three to four members of staff teaching and undertaking research which was acknowledged as outstanding and seamlessly fitting into the high academic standard of the College. To my amazement and delight, the Heads of the major, internationally respected departments stood up, one after the other and declared their support for HOST. They firmly stated that current achievements in science had been built on the foundation laid by our predecessors. That there is a continuity of scientific discoveries, and that the past belongs to us, it is therefore our duty to keep its memory alive. What better way to do that than to maintain HOST? I felt that I was witnessing something unique: the declaration of solidarity of scientists both past and present.

It was, therefore, with great sadness that I have learned of the transfer of HOST to King’s College London. I am sure that there must have been a serious debate in College regarding the decision and it is not my intension to question why this had to happen. The memory of that Heads of Departments meeting, however, will stay with me forever, the image of a magnanimous College firmly believing in “one culture” – science and arts combined – which few institutions were ever able to demonstrate. What remains now is to say farewell to HOST, wishing it a happy and prosperous future – alas, in another institution.
