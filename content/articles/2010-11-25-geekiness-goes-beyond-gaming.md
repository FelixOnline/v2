This week I played some videogames. You might think that this isn’t particularly announcement–worthy in an age of Farmville and Bejewelled. On the face of it, videogames are part of our culture now. But read a gaming fansite or web forum and you’d be forgiven for thinking we were in the middle of a cultural apartheid.

Does anyone actually care about videogames any more? I’m talking about the giggling disdain that used to be poured on people who play them. I’m not sure this actually exists any more, and weirdly, the gaming hardcore seem to be pining for its return. Mike Channell wrote on the Official XBox Magazine Blog that “Games won’t get you the girl - yet” last week. The piece is a genuinely unbelievable anecdote about meeting a ‘reasonably cute’ girl (so kind, Mike) at a game launch party.

Bearing in mind that Miss Above Average Looks was attending a party designed to celebrate a videogame, Mike claims she was surprised and disgusted to learn what Mike did for a living. If she really was surprised, then that’s some remarkable ignorance on her part. Maybe she thought the party was celebrating some new, very interactive film or something. Mike goes on to explain how horrible she was, and then remark that her kind is ‘dying out’, in a rather ominous sentence. Then it’s time for the rallying call. Over to Mike for this bit:

“We’re not there yet, though, and you and I are just leading the charge. No matter how cool it is that more people are gaming...there are still going to be people who think we’re worthless human belly button fluff. But you know what? They’re wrong and we’re right. Remember that.”

Please bear in mind that Mike reviews videogames in exchange for a monthly salary. He isn’t leading a guerilla resistance movement or fighting against social oppression. Instead of playing games in the evening, someone is willing to pay him to do it during the day, on the condition he writes about them a bit. That’s it. He closes with this killer shot: “Farewell angry lady, I hope one day you’re having as much fun as I am.”

ZING. Don’t hold out, Mike! Go for the jugular!

Here’s the thing; videogames are cool now. Almost everyone plays them, and very few people genuinely would be disgusted to meet someone who wrote about them for a living. Of course, that gave gamers an identity: The Underdog. Now that’s gone, it seems some of them - particularly journalists, for whom this role generated a lot of material - are realising that role hasn’t been replaced with something exciting or sexy. They’re now just ‘dude who plays videogames’.

So this week, readers, I played videogames. That’s it. Maybe you read a book. I respect your choice of entertainment and don’t wish to bring any judgement against you. However, if you see any Mike Channells out there this week, be sure to round them up and execute them on sight. The only thing making gaming unpopular these days are the ove rcompensating twunts who thought it would always be that way.

Are you, or is someone you know, Mike Channell? Do you know someone affected by Mike Channell?
