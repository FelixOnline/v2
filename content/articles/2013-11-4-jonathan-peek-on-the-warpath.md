If there is one thing the our Union has got right is its ability to generate endless of amounts bureaucracy and suffer a constant stream of changing individuals filling roles without much of an idea of what they’re supposed to be doing or even being qualified to complete their role.

Anyone who has experienced the hours of endless joy that is Union Council is well aware that things can be a right shambles. Our current constitution was replaced last year with little consultation using a template that was designed by the NUS despite our own Union having a rather more completed legal standing as defined in the Imperial College Charter (the Union may or may not be a separate legal entity).

In fact the sweeping changes brought in by the new constitution are so radical that the body charged with advising on the impact of constitutional changes, the Union Court (which was abolished as part of the changes) provided a report detailing some of the issues with the proposed constitution which was longer the constitution itself.

Anyone at this week’s Council meeting would have seen a lengthy debate about the Government’s Immigration Bill which culminated with the final decision being that we couldn’t make a decision at the time despite numerous good proposals that addressed peoples points being proposed, while aware that prompt action was needed if the Union wished to actually accomplish anything regarding the bill.  
 If there is one thing that does help keep the Union running from day to day it is the team of approximately 50 employed professionals that actually oversee the running of the Union behind the scenes. These people actually have a vested interest in seeing the Union be successful. Some individuals who are familiar with how the Union operates often refer to the Sabbatical officers as puppets.

Despite the issues with the new constitution, changes were needed. Talking about the old arrangements of the Union’s government the Chair of the Trustee Board, Dame Julia Higgins, said that the Union’s “systems were flawed and failing in governance” (Union Council Minutes 30 October 2012).  
 Aside for the issue of a constant changing team of individuals with oversight of the Union and its activities, the fact that these individuals are selected by a popularity contest means that it is often not the best individual that gets the post. Yes, we run a College wide ballot and, yes, we have some the best turnout for the “Big Elections” but if you actually look at voter turnout for most of the other roles in the Union e.g. the members of Union Council (the board responsible for keeping oversight of the Sabbs and Trustees as well as being ‘the representative body’ of the Union) the turnout is depressingly low and the result is dramatically effected by the popularity of the individual running. So when you then think about who actually runs for the posts of Sabbatical officers its almost always the people who have been involved the Union and hence got in though being popular. The number of times I’ve heard people complain that “actually none of the candidates for this Sabb role are any good” is far to high to be consistent with the idea of the elections being the best way of appointing people for the posts and system of governance working for us – how many of you have complained about, or tried to do something with a club society or project simply to get tied up in endless amounts procedural matters?  
 So what’s my solution? Well simply what we need is for people who would actually make good officers to take an interest in the Union, and we (as a voting body) need to vote for the person who would actually be best rather than who we know – unfortunately this requires less voter apathy and actually an election process that prompts informed voting. The good news is that we do have at least one basic test as part of the election process: if you haven’t written a manifesto or uploaded a photo then good luck trying to beat RON.
