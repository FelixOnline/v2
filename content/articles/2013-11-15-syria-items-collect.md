There is an items collection for an aid convoy that will be leaving for Syria next weekend. This is an opportunity for you to directly make a difference to people’s lives! Old clothes will be used to generate funds and new ones will be sent to Syria. The Union is also helping and we have a drop off point at the Union reception. There are more details on the website.

One of the organisers commented “anyone can contribute, as students we tend to have a lot of little things that we rarely use or wear; this little will go a long way, it will provide them with hope and show the Syrian people that others in the world do care and do remember.”

One of the students response to the campaign was “It’s easy to feel powerless in the face of things that shock and upset us, yet instead of surrendering themselves to apathy a young group of Imperial students have built a campaign from nothing, it’s very impressive and has certainly inspired me.”
 Suggested Items:
 MOST REQUIRED MEDICINE: Generally any over the counter but also Antibiotics, Insulin, Amlodipine, Atenolol, Ibuprofen, Colic remedy, Paracetamol, First Aid Packs.
