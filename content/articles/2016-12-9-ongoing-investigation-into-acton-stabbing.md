The Metropolitan police are still searching for a minicab driver they believe played a role in the fatal stabbing of 18-year-old Khalid Safi on December 1st – which occurred near Woodward Buildings, one of Imperial College’s residence halls.

Safi, who was living in Southwark, was stabbed in the heart following a fight between two men at 6:30 last Thursday, the Evening Standard reported.

Detective Chief Inspector Sam Price, who is leading the investigation, said there were a lot of people in the area when the stabbing occurred.

“Whilst we have spoken with the woman we had previously appealed for, I believe that not everyone has come forward at this time,” he said.

Several international students told the Evening Standard they were scared but that police were giving them limited information.

Dr. Julia Hillier, Imperial College’s Director of Student Tutoring, emailed students following the attack.

“I know that many of you are living in Woodward Halls, and this incident may be a shock,” she wrote. “I encourage you to contact your tutor or one of the senior tutors if you need support at this time.”

According to the email, a support meeting for students took place Monday at 4pm in Study Room 1 of Woodward Halls.

Woodward Halls is the newest residence hall, standing 19 stories high and housing 690 beds. Prices range from £98-145 per week.

Several people tweeted about the incident, including _@hostileholly5w_: “Another aspiring rapper dies on Londons crime filled, third world streets...”

Others called on minicab licensers and politicians to solve the crisis, including _@brianbarou_, who tagged UKIP London Assembly member David Kurten and Caroline Pidegon, Chair of the Transport Committee at City Hall, and Mayor Sadiq Khan, among others.

Police are still searching for the driver of a silver or light-coloured Mercedes Vito carrier or similar model, the Evening Standard reported.

Tipsters are asked to call the police incident room on 020 8721 4054.
