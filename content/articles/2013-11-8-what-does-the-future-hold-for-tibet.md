     Chines community is really lack of shame ,"...the Dalai Lama has been in exile since 1952.."? <br> <br>Really? <br> <br>It can not be more ironic that this article that pompously ridicules people's ignorance on Tibet does not even have the rudimentary facts right.,well i suppose that was the whole point of the article published this week.... propaganda or not, you need to get your numbers/data/evidence/facts right, this is imperial college london, a SCIENCE university, *sigh*,Dalai Lama has been in exile since 1959... true that was a mistake. Still... the article was about what is happening in Tibet CURRENTLY. Does the fact that the Dalai Lama was exiled in 1959 as opposed to 1952 (huge mistake on my part and I really apologise for that) change Tibet's situation as an occupied nation, in which human rights have been severely abused? Then about the article published this week... it's impossible to deny that it was propaganda... and it's "whole" point was definitely not to point out that numbers need to be correct... it's

At least 120 Tibetans have set themselves alight in protest against Chinese rule since 2009. It’s the only peaceful way they’ve been able to broadcast their recurrent message: Save Tibet. It seems that their message has fallen on deaf ears. When you ask most people what they know about Tibet common answers would be “it’s part of China isn’t it?”, or “it’s where the Dalai Lama lives…” Whilst the second answer is significantly wrong and the Dalai Lama has been in exile since 1952 the first answer, though technically correct, completely undermines and puts into perspective Tibet’s efforts to fight peacefully for independence for over 50 years.

So what is Tibet? Tibet is situated in the western part of China, on the Tibetan plateau, encompassing ¼ of Chinese landmass which, including traditional Tibetan provinces, have been gradually assimilated into the Sichuan and Qinghai regions. Now known as the Tibet Autonomous Region (though it holds no real autonomy from Beijing) TAR has a population of around 6 million Tibetans and over 7 million Chinese who, following occupation in 1952, have been forcefully relocated to Tibet, making Tibetans the minority population in their own land. Prior to its occupation it was a historically and politically independent country with its own language, alphabet (both of which hold no similarities to Chinese Mandarin), distinct culture and religion (Tibetan Buddhism). H.H. Dalai Lama is the spiritual and political head of Tibet,giving you an idea of the values that the Tibetan nation holds.
 It is a nation that, due to its pacifist policies, had no power to withstand an occupation. It has a unique culture preserved within the heights of the Himalaya and remained untouched until Chinese occupation. Ever since its days of peaceful Buddhist practice Tibet’s situation has gravely changed. Human rights have failed, Tibet’s culture and religious practices have been heavily oppressed. Environmental destruction as a consequence of burgeoning infastructure in Tibet (adhering to China’s energy needs) are endangering Tibet’s fragile environment. According to NGO ‘Friends of Tibet’ the ingidenous population has dramatically declined.

Monasteries have been destroyed, especially in Lhasa, obstructed by new buildings, plastic palm trees (I kid you not) and plans of an airport. Monks have been imprisoned (the majority of Tibetan prisoners are monks) and tortured. The Tibetan flag has been banned, possession of a photograph of the Dalai Lama lands you in prison and celebrating his birthday on a sacred mountain is not advised (as demonstrated by 9th July 2013).
 How has the rest of the world sat back whilst the most peaceful nation is slowly being eradicated? It has been students who have pushed for Tibet’s cause in the West, more so than politicians who have turned a blind eye to human rights violations. On the 22nd October, at the quadrennial UN Human right’s review in Geneva, “Students for a Free Tibet” managed to break through security and scaled scaffolding at the UN headquarters in Geneva with a banner saying: “China fails human rights - UN stand up for Tibet”. On Tuesday 5th November student activists protested at the Intercontinental Hotel in Westminster against Intercontinental’s plans to build a 5000 room hotel in Lhasa. The plans indirectly give licence to Chinese plans of turning Tibet into a commercialized concrete jungle. Multiple NGOs, united action and continuous protests land the Tibetan’s cause in the headlines frequently. While unforeseeable in the near future, for Tibet to become truly autonomous, let alone independent, it does not seem a lost cause.
 Once aware of Tibet’s situation, I feel compelled to take action . If you’re interested in supporting Tibet, visit www.studentsforafreetibet.org and like the Students for a free Tibet Imperial College facebook page for regular updates.
