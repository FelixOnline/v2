In the northern corner of Parson’s Green stands the long established Fulham favourite, The White Horse, known for its unpretentious seasonal menus, extensive drinks selection and reasonable prices. Its location makes this restaurant perfect for the large proportion of Imperial Students who live in or very close to Fulham. There are two main eating areas: the upstairs, in which you feel as though Nelson could have plotted his defeat of the French over a cheeky pint, the second (and my favourite), the downstairs conservatory, which has an intimate feel, with candles set into the exposed brick walls.

I’ll start with the food, which is superb and excellent value for money. The White Horse offers a typical gastro pub menu which is regularly changed to suit what’s in season, from game to seasonal vegetables, with the specials board updated even more frequently. My favourite dish over summer was the Seared Duck’s Breast Salad (£12). The breast was perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside with a pink, tender centre and was accompanied by a delicious salad of green beans, grilled feta cheese, dressed mixed leaves, baby new potatoes, sweet plum tomatoes and beetroot. The saltiness of the feta really complemented the sweetness of the beetroot, tomatoes and balsamic dressing. But don’t worry, this isn’t a place known for its poncy, complicated salads: a favourite of my boyfriend is the hearty portion of classic British fish and chips, served with fresh mushy peas and hollandaise sauce (£11) - you definitely get your money’s worth with this dish. I can also recommend the lamb shank and the sea bass (but some dishes are meant for paying parents to treat their hardworking sons or daughters to!). The puddings also come in decent portions, enough for two to share, and the cheese board (including some excellently chosen cheeses) could easily be stretched to three. Personally I cannot resist the Chocolate Almond Torte (£5) when it’s on the menu. It is a classic example of a beautifully balanced, bittersweet pudding, and is complimented by thick crème fraîche, the texture of the torte made more interesting by the use of ground almonds instead of flour.

At The White Horse there is no drinks menu. Instead they have an A4 drinks book. Being what feels like the only person at Imperial who doesn’t drink beer, I cannot personally vouch for The White Horse’s renowned beer and ale selection (from £2.80 a pint), but I have it on good authority that it is fantastic. The ever helpful waiters and waitresses will happily help you tailor your drink to your meal (The White Horse also hold regular beer and food matching lessons). However I can tell you more about the amazing wine selection. As a student their cheapest wine (at £3.70 a glass) is excellent value, very drinkable and a perfect accompaniment to the red meat dishes (and the duck salad!). At the White Horse there is no concept of a cheap, bland, acidic ‘house’ wine. Having taken a complete wine buff on a couple of occasions, I’m pretty sure you won’t be disappointed with the selection.

For me The White Horse is the perfect place both for a romantic meal or a relaxed dinner with friends. I’ve never come away feeling disappointed, either with the food nor the prices! The atmosphere fuels conversation, and even if you’re talked out, you can always resort to people watching: The White Horse is normally full of ‘Tarquins’!
