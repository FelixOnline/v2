Gassho! Two weeks ago, kenshi (or students) practising Shorinji Kempo, a Japanese martial art, flew in from around the world to participate in an intense two-day seminar held in Bristol. Kenshi from dojos in England, Scotland, Ireland, Spain, Czech Republic, Switzerland, and Japan all came to learn from each other. For many of us this was our first international seminar, and the first time we would train and learn from our overseas counterparts. Shorinji Kempo is designed to effectively subdue any attacker with minimal damage by using acupressure and the attacker’s momentum against them. As a result, the size of the attacker should not matter when it comes to self-defence, and this was certainly put to the test at the IKA (International Kempo Association) seminar as individuals of all sizes trained together. The acupressure comes in helpful later too as massage (seiho) is also taught – helpful to soothe the aching joints and muscles of some of our more senior kenshi.

As well as intense training, international seminars also provide an opportunity for everyone attending to socialise with one another. This year, Bristol Shorinji Kempo arranged a suitably-British boat pub crawl around the city Harbour on the first night of the event, an evening of seeing lions and monkeys as well as a dining and dancing experience at Bristol zoo, and a survivor’s party on the final night. Other highlights of the event included learning from chief instructors from each country, the Taikai (either single or group demonstrations of a series of techniques in front of an audience), and the fantastic boy-band style dance moves from our very own club secretary, D.A. Williams.

The international seminars are held every year in a different participating country of the IKA, with the previous seminar taking place in Spain and making the national news.

Shorinji Kempo is a modern Japanese martial art, where striking and throwing techniques are blended together seamlessly with meaningful and practical philosophy. It teaches self-confidence, cooperation, and mutual respect. Every week we train in both hard methods (punches, strikes and kicks) and soft methods (releases and throws), eventually combining the two into a beautiful and dynamic system of martial practice. Zen philosophy underpins the training and is essential for both mental and physical growth.

As Shorinji Kempo is non-competitive and holistic, the aim of practice is for everyone to benefit, grow stronger and learn the art of self-defence. Particularly when an hour-long “15-minute walk” has turned your tired captain angry, and you’re next to a very tall bridge.
