The first thing to capture your attention when entering the theatre is the great mirror which extends above the stage. The reflective structure is only one of many creative tools present in this production through which the main character’s unique story-telling is done. The minimal but effective set design includes the use of salt to distinguish different settings and chalk sketches drawn on the floor during the play. 

In the theatrical adaptation of Alice Sebold’s bestseller The Lovely Bones (2002), Susie Salmon, a fourteen-year-old girl in heaven, tells us about life on earth after her murder. The mirror gives the audience a second perspective with which to observe and interpret the lives on stage, in relation to Susie’s life in heaven. These two distinct worlds merge seamlessly and beautifully reflect Susie’s ethereal yet still tangible presence on earth, which influences other characters’ thinking.

Though it may seem like a dark and depressing basis for a play, the upbeat tempo, witty dialogue and Susie’s amusingly teenage mindset introduce a humorous aspect and keep the audience engaged with the story. In addition, the unexpected responses of her family and friends to the obstacles they face show the spontaneous and human side of their character. The contrast allows the audience to explore the situation from a fresh perspective.

Nevertheless, what most stand out are the emotional bonds between Susie and her loved ones. The characters on earth deal with nostalgia and saudade while being forced to let go of the past. Meanwhile, from heaven, Susie guides her family to who her assassin is, as a way to move on herself. The few scenes where Susie manages to cross the boundary  portray the characters’ suffering intensely and emphasize the feeling of helplessness as they let out a cry of rage and agony. Even as onlookers, we connect with them at a personal level and find ourselves identifying with the emotions of various characters. Out of the cast Charlotte Beaumont gives a particularly moving performance as the main character Susie, with Catrin Aaron and Leigh Lothian also delivering poignant performances as Susie’s mother and classmate respectively. 

Adapted for the stage by Broyony Lavery and directed by Melly Still, Birmingham Repertory Theatre’s The Lovely Bones is on tour in the UK until the end of November 2019. A play to be recommended to any young adults because of how it covers the painful topic of loss and breaking apart in a warmhearted and relatable way. The 1-hour delay of the performance and the few technical issues on the night seemed a minor inconvenience in comparison to the depth of the meaning behind the play, which left us with a greater appreciation for life.
