Forget orchestral scores, these are songs you would actually listen to. Or maybe you like to have the shower scene from _Psycho_ on repeat during your walk to college every morning, I’m not here to judge.

Layer Cake

_“Fucking females is for poofs.”_From the opening scene with FC Kahuna’s ‘Hayling,’ you know this film’s going to have a good selection of music. Featuring recognisable songs from The Cult, Duran Duran and Joe Cocker, the music emphasises the exciting but lonely life of the protagonist. Well worth a watch, particularly if you want to perfect your cockney accent.

Twilight

_“Are you still faint from the run? Or was it my kissing expertise?”_Okay, before you spit on the page in disgust and set the whole paper on fire, let me explain. The music is actually pretty darn good. The first three soundtracks had contributions from Florence + the Machine, Bat for Lashes, The Black Keys and Thom Yorke, and Muse even went as far as to do a song for each OST. Who cares if you think Edward Cullen’s a bit of a knob, just listen to the music.

The Craft

_“Light as a feather, stiff as a board.”_The ‘How Soon Is Now?’ cover may irritate the traditionalists in the audience, but if you’re looking for a 90s throwback you’ll be hard pushed to find a better OST. ‘All This and Nothing’ and ‘Dangerous Type’ are sure to get you in an angsty teen mood. So girls, roll up your skirts, pull up your socks, get out your neck chokers and slap on some dark lipstick – we’re going slutty gothic gunge. With witchcraft, of course.

Reservoir Dogs

_“You keep talking like a bitch, I’m gonna slap you like a bitch.”_Yes, the film where every character sounds like a piece in Cluedo is brilliant for some retro tunes, something that Tarantino successfully does in each of his bloody masterpieces. He mixes upbeat tracks such as ‘Stuck in the Middle with You’ with horrible gore that, in a very disturbing way, makes you almost enjoy the violence. I challenge anyone after seeing this to walk down the street in a suit and NOT have the burning desire to walk in slow motion to ‘Little Green Bag’ playing in their head.

(500) Days of Summer

_“Just because she likes the same bizzaro crap you do doesn’t mean she’s your soul mate.”_A film that I watch over and over, despite how much it irritates me. Some chilled music from Doves, Carla Bruni (who doesn’t love a cute French voice whisper-singing in your ears?) and The Temper Trap, and there’s a brilliant scene with sunshine and cartoon birds accompanied by the Hall and Oates track ‘You Make My Dreams.’
