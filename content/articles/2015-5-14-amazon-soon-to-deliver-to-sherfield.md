A new Amazon collection point has been installed on campus, allowing staff and students to receive their parcels from South Kensington instead of waiting in at home.

The locker system, based on the Sherfield Walkway, has 84 units of varying sizes that can hold parcels for three days before they are sent back to the original sender. When students place an order online, they will be given a code to access the goods.

Although the lockers are not ready to use quite yet, they will soon be set up and will also be accessible by members of the public.

The preparation costs to install the lockers were covered by College Estates, but Amazon has covered the gross cost of the lockers as a whole.

Imperial has seen an increasing number of parcels being delivered to campus. In December, over 2,000 packages were sent to campus, whilst another 1,800 were sent in January.

Felix spoke to Estates, who are responsible for the lockers. A spokesperson told us: “The lockers will hopefully take the pressure of the post room, and deliver a great service that both staff and students can enjoy.”

Estates will publicise when the lockers are available for use later on in the term.
