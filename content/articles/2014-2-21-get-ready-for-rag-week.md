RAG Week 2014 is coming! RAG gives you a unique opportunity to have the time of your life, while doing something good for the world.This year we are supporting three great charities: Caritas Anchor House, a residential and lifeskills centre in London for single homeless people aged 19 to 65; Breakthrough Breast Cancer, a force of thousands of people across the UK working together with a single-minded ambition to stop women dying from breast cancer; and Practical Action, a charity that uses technology to challenge poverty in developing countries.

Everyone loves a cheeky weekend away, and we’re offering you exactly that! 1-2nd March – it’s your time to Jailbreak! Your mission: get as far away from Imperial College Union as possible in 36 hours! The catch? You can’t spend a penny doing it! Whether you hitch hike across the channel or head to Heathrow to blag a free flight this will be one of the best weekends of your life! Start getting your team (2-3 people) together now. Make sure you sign up on our website icragweek.com.

For more information and tickets, head over to our website www.icragweek.com, and GET EXCITED!
