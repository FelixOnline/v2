Five teams of Imperial students who entered BP's Ultimate Field Trip competition are through to the semi finals, in which they will compete by presenting their ideas on tackling the carbon challenge to a panel of BP experts. The fifteen students are competing for the opportunity to receive a paid internship with BP in their North Sea business unit this summer.

 The five teams were selected from fifty two entries after grabbing the attention of the judges with their initial five minute pitches. The expert panel, formed of some of BP's leading scientists and CCS experts, were especially satisfied with the ideas presented and the concepts proposed.

 The teams are: SINCE, formed of Chia Wei Hong James, Aw Seng Sean and Yuen Yu Leng, who are first years studying Chemical Engineering; Meltdown, consisting of Lizzie Riley, Chris Hunter and Ben Said, who are second years, studying an MSc in Geology; IC Engineers, made up of first year Chemical Engineers Eugenia Ho, Eileen Brandley and Yan Isis Xie; Hot Carbon, with second years Tom Wesby, (MSc in Geology & Geophysics), Carmen Pinto-Ward and Miriam Wright (MSc in Geology); and West 3, formed by first years Patrick Delaney studying Geology & Geophysics, Lee Shyen Lee studying Chemical Engineering and Mikaela Bryant-Meisner studying Physics.

 The students will have to compete against teams from the University of Cambridge, Durham, University of Aberdeen, Robert Gordon University, University of Oxford, University of Nottingham and the University of Manchester. The Imperial teams will present their ideas in February at one of three regional semi finals, where up to six teams will enter the final on April 12th at the Natural History Museum, hosted by BBC broadcaster, John Humphreys. Progress can be followed online via the #BPFieldTrip Twitter.
