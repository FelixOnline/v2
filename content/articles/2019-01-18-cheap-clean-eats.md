Now that the new year has started, how many of those “new year, new me” posts have you seen floating around? It’s nice to think we can have a fresh start as soon as the year begins, but those first few days up until term restarts are so much of a limbo, it’s pretty much impossible to send any form of resolution into action. However, now that we’re more settled, we thought we’d tackle a few of the resolutions we’ve heard floating around, mainly deciding to save a little money and budget more, and eat a little healthier – two birds, one stone. 

We’ve been out on the hunt (Google), and have managed to round up the best of the best. Whether you’re looking for an indulgent breakfast, or a nourishing hearty lunch, we’ve got all the recipes that aren’t going to harm your bank account or your figure!

**Breakfast**

**Catharina’s Protein Boost Pancakes**

_Ingredients_

- 100g shredded oats (or 50/50 protein powder for those ~gains~) 
- 2 bananas, chopped
- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 100-200ml cup milk*
- 1 teaspoon cinammon

*Can substitute water 

_Optional Extras_

Blueberries, maple syrup, basically anything!!

_Method_

1. Mix the oats and baking powder together
1. Mash in the banana with a fork. 
1. Add in the milk slowly, and keep whisking till desired consistency is achieved. 
1. Grease a frying pan, and add enough of the mixture to create a thin base, and once bubbles start forming, flip the pancake. 
1. Enjoy!!

**Cassey’s Omelette in a Mug**

![](https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/felixonline/2018_felix_issues/issue_1710/1710_food_omelette.png)

This is one of our all-time favourites, and once you make it, you’ll find out why. Sourced from the internet’s favourite sweetheart, Cassey Ho, better known as Blogilates.

_Ingredients_

- Two eggs
- One egg white
- 1/3 cup mushrooms, chopped
- 1/4 cup red bell pepper, diced
- Two tablespoons red onion, minced
- Pinch of salt
- Pinch of garlic powder
- 1/4 cup shredded cheese or vegan cheese, divided
- One tablespoon avocado, optional


_Method_

1. Add the egg, egg whites, mushrooms, bell pepper, onion, salt, garlic and half the cheese into a 12-ounce or larger Mason jar coated with cooking spray. Shake or stir to combine, then seal with a lid unless making immediately.
1. Place in fridge overnight or until ready to prepare.
1. Remove lid, place in microwave, and heat for about two minutes, watching for overflow. If the eggs puff up too much, simply open the microwave for five seconds, then heat again until no liquid remains. Top with remaining cheese, and serve. Top with avocado, if using.

**Lunch**

**Cassey’s Healthy Falafel Lettuce Wraps**

![](https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/felixonline/2018_felix_issues/issue_1710/1710_food_falafel.png)

_Ingredients_

- 2 1/2 whole-wheat or high-fiber pitas
- One 15-oz. can chickpeas, well drained
- One onion, very finely chopped
- 1/4 cup whole-wheat flour
- Three tbsp. finely chopped fresh parsley
- 1 1/2 tbsp. chopped garlic
- One tbsp. chopped fresh cilantro
- 1/2 tbsp. ground cumin
- 3/4 tsp. salt
- 1/2 tsp. baking powder
- 1/4 tsp. lemon juice


_Method_

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
1. Place all ingredients for falafel (except for the pitas and nonstick spray) in a large bowl, and give them a good stir. Using a potato masher, mash well. Mixture should remain slightly chunky, not smooth.
1. Spray a baking sheet thoroughly with a two-second spray of olive oil nonstick spray.
1. One at a time, take spoonfuls of mixture in your hands and form 15 balls, each about the size of a ping pong ball, and gently place them on the baking sheet. Spray the top of each ball with olive oil nonstick spray, for a total of about a two-second spray.
1. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, combine all ingredients for dip in a blender or food processor, and pulse until just blended. Season to taste with black pepper and refrigerate until ready to serve.
1. Remove baking sheet from the oven, and carefully turn each ball over, gently reshaping if the bottoms have flattened. Return to the oven and bake for an additional 10 – 15 minutes, until golden brown and slightly crispy. Allow to cool and set for at least five minutes.
1. Cut the whole pitas into halves, toast or warm all pita halves slightly, and then fill each with three falafel balls and three tbsp. dip. Enjoy!

**Dinner**
