Musician. Freedom fighter. Sax, trumpet and keyboard player. Polygamist. Fela Ransome Kuti, the Father of Afrobeat, was something of a phenomenon. His infectious and politically charged music was quick to sweep the African continent and then the world throughout the 70s and beyond. He created a wild and free counter-culture against what was a tyrannically controlled, neo-colonial Nigeria. And he had an absolute blast while he did it.

It is no longer 2010 and we are no longer on London’s Southbank. The auditorium of the Olivier Theatre has been transformed by colourful, crazy artwork, slogans of protest, a live band and draped with the flags of the fifty countries of Africa. We are now at the Shrine – Fela’s infamous Lagos club – and it is 1978. Nigeria is still in disarray from an oil crisis and a military coup three years before: British colonialists swapped for military ones.We watch the man himself sing, dance, entertain and involve the crowd with the help of scantily clad dancers and a roaring live band, his Africa 70. Watching the dazzling cast is like crashing a party that was going on anyway; there’s such apparent spontaneity that it’s hard not to smile and feel frustrated at being confined to one’s seat.

The show is close to three hours of whirlwind colour, drumming and booty shaking – pure energy. It is dazzling, a riotous rollercoaster ride. The Nigerian zeal and lust for life is there and palpable both on stage and among the audience. But its tempo and variety is such that it does not become overbearing. The frenetic dance and music scenes are broken down with anecdotes about past run-ins with the police told while Fela puffs on a fat one – Igbo – and some audience participation (be ready to get off your ass and gyrate that pelvis). Sahr Ngaujah is flawless and gives a seamless performance with unending vigour as the man himself. Praise is needed for Paulette Ivory’s jaw-dropping voice in the role of Sandra also, the American girl who turns Fela on to the ideas of the Black Movement.

As well as all the frivolity one expects from Lagos’ most notorious club, FELA! manages to shock us with the violence and gravity of what was being carried out by the dictatorship at the time. Equally moving is the final scene where coffin after coffin is brought onto stage as a chilling reminder of the horrors that occurred against Africans in both Nigeria and in America.

Designer Marina Draghici has done a stupendous job, with costumes and make up worn superbly by the Queens, although both the wardrobe and artwork that adorns the theatre seem to have undergone a slight day-glo make over, if archive footage of the real Shrine is anything to go by.

Bill T. Jones is the multi-talented director, writer and choreographer of this piece which has run both Off and On Broadway before arriving at the National. Produced in association with the likes of Jay-Z and Will Smith, the idea was originally conceived by Stephen Hendel who was inspired after listening to Fela’s music to pay homage to his achievements for human rights in Nigeria.

For a first hand experience of the New Africa Shrine, head over to Lagos in October, where each year Fela’s sons lead the ‘Felabration’, commemorating and celebrating the life of this revered pioneer. Even if you can’t afford the flights to Nigeria or not, don’t miss FELA! at the NT

Until 23rd January. From £10
