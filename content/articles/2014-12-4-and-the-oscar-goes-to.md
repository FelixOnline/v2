It’s December, which means only one thing. The Oscar Race has officially begun. The New York Film Critics Circle has announced their winners, the Gotham Awards have given out their trophies to the independent films worthy of recognition, the National Board of Review have also announced, the Los Angeles Critics will soon follow, building up the excitement surrounding some of this year’s best films.

Even in the months ahead of such events, pundits, critics and fans alike love to speculate over who will be the big winner come Oscar night. It is still without doubt the biggest night in Hollywood, celebrated at the very end of the long awards calendar. Celebrating films of this year, the Academy Awards will be held on 22nd February 2015, hosted by Neil Patrick Harris. Already the buzz is strong on certain films and performers, and this week Felix Film looks at the hotly anticipated contenders whose names and performances you should watch out for in the coming months. And let the long, intense, competitive race begin.

__Best Leading Actor__

A lot of worthy names fighting out for the Oscar with no clear winner set as of yet but the States should brace themselves for a healthy amount of British invasion, withactors __Benedict Cumberbatch ___(The Imitation Game)_, __Eddie Redmayne___(The Theory of Everything), _Cannes winner __Timothy Spall ___(Mr Turner), _and __David Oyelowo___(Selma) _in hot contention for their performances. They all played real-life heroes, (Alan Turing, Stephen Hawking, J. M. W. Turner, and Martin Luther King Jr., respectively) which will work hugely in their favour, but the main focus at the moment is on __Michael Keaton__, who has put on a performance of a lifetime in _Birdman_. Would you also believe that __Steve Carell ___(Foxcatcher) _could cause a serious upset at Keaton’s chances? Others who should not be overlooked but have a high chance of getting unjustly ignored are performers whose films have not been seen widely. __Chadwick Boseman___(Get On Up) _is a revelation as James Brown, and __Jake Gyllenhaal ___(Nightcrawler) _is brilliantly mad.

__Best Leading Actress__

__Julianne Moore___(Still Alice) _can most certainly expect nominations to start flooding in, given her wonderfully measured, masterful performance as a linguistic professor with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. It is about time for Moore to score some awards, given years of injustices of missing out on wins and nominations, and she may as well start polishing up on her acceptance speeches. __Reese Witherspoon___(Wild) _for a while was the frontrunner, displaying a strong, moving performance in a film that is very well-reviewed, __Amy Adams___(Big Eyes) _practically scores a deserving nomination in whatever serious role she plays, and there is talk of Brit newcomer __Felicity Jones___(The Theory of Everything) _also joining the mix. __Hilary Swank___ (The Homesman) _may be a serious contender to the remaining space in her feminist Western. Critics may be divided over the quality of _Gone Girl_, but they are unanimous in praising __Rosamund Pike__’s frighteningly unforgettable performance. Is there space for __Essie Davis ___(The Babadook_)? Possibly not.

__Best Supporting Actor__

__J. K. Simmons ___(Whiplash) _should be in for a very clean sweep of every single Best Supporting Actor award there is out there, for his ferocious turn as a ruthless jazz band conductor who will stop at nothing to achieve the absolute best from his students. __Edward Norton ___(Birdman) _is the most likely candidate running for distant second, veteran actors __Robert Duvall ___(The Judge)_, __Tom Wilkinson___(Selma) _and __Christoph Waltz ___(Big Eyes) _are all gunning for spots, (this would mark Waltz’s third time in the category) and Duvall in particular seems to be likely to get in on the race, given his success with the Hollywood Film Awards earlier this year. It has been awhile since the underrated __Ethan Hawke ___(Boyhood) _has scored a nomination, but his strong supporting turn in what many argue as this 2014’s best film, gives him a big boost into the possibility of a nomination. Another cast member of _Foxcatcher _receiving attention for this performance is __Mark Ruffalo, __who might just get squeezed out given how much competition there is.

__Best Supporting Actress__

Hot off her New York Film Critics’ Best Supporting Actress win, it is full steam ahead for __Patricia Arquette___(Boyhood)_ in her quest to win her first Oscar. She has had success on television, and is now displaying her talent returning to the big screen. __Keira Knightley___(The Imitation Game)_ has won rave reviews for her warm, tender performance opposite Cumberbatch. A part of what made _Wild_ special was the presence of __Laura Dern __providing excellent support for Witherspoon as the character’s mother, and everyone seems to have picked up on this, given the buzz surrounding her contribution to the film. It wouldn’t be Oscar season without the mention of __Meryl Streep__’s _(Into the Woods)_ name, and her latest musical effort might help her score her 19th nomination. That’s right. 19th. __Emma Stone ___(Birdman) _could be looking at a first-ever nomination in a film loved by pretty much everyone, and if anyone was looking for an acting nomination with_ Interstellar_, __Jessica Chastain__ could be the one.
