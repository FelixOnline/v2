You will need...

- 1 kg Brussels sprouts
- 50 gr butter
- 4 tsp vegetable oil
- 20 gr almonds
- 400 ml double cream
- 5 tsp lemon juice
- 5 tbsp breadcrumbs
- freshly grated parmesan (the more, the better)
- a pinch of salt
- black pepper

1. Simmer salted water in a saucepan. Add the Brussels sprouts and boil them for 4-5 minutes (they do not have to be perfectly cooked). Make sure that all of them all covered by water so they are cooked evenly. 
1. Let them cool for a while and after that, cut them in halves.
1. In a heated frying pan, add the butter and oil. Add the sprouts and fry them for another 2-3 minutes.
1. Add the cream and let the mixture boil for another 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
1. Transfer the mixture into a baking dish and add the lemon juice. 
1. Sprinkle the top with parmesan and breadcrumb until evenly covered.
1. Bake into the preheated oven (200ºC) for 20 minutes – check for the top which should be golden and the cream and cheese should boil.
