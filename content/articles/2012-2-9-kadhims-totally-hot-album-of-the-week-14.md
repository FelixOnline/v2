I’m bAAAAAck! Terribly sorry about last week; unfortunately my ghostwriter was on holiday, so doing my column was a bit trickier than expected. But now that he’s taken his leave for the next 12 years, we can continue on as normal. __Django Django’__s _Django Django [[Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/album/3pqPOPqLgIwLaE4ZuVhYlg)]_ is this week’s Totally Hot Album of the Week (try saying that while covered in cheese, hanging upside down from a [monkey’s uncle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQG10A-ymtg)). The 1st class students amongst you may have noticed that, that sentence didn’t make sense; this album is just as awesomely weird.

There comes a point in a lecture, just moments before the end of a long and complex derivation, when your higher brain functions collapse. 30 minutes of barely comprehensible lecturing lead you to the end of the Yellow Brick Road when out of nowhere your brain says, “Fuck this”.

At those times, you need something different, something to cleanse the mental palate; maybe something a bit 60s; maybe something a bit psychedelic rock; maybe something __Paul Simon__-esque? Ahhh, Django Django, you are the perfect cure to a hectic week.

Like a crisp, chilly lemon sorbet, Django Django isn’t for large-scale consumption. But if you feel like heavy weights are pressing into your temples, this album could be your saviour.

_If you feel irreconciably aggrieved by this column’s absence last week, tweet me [@kadhimshubber](http://twitter.com/kadhimshubber) and call me “a swine!” Alternatively go post some Imperial-related memes on __[facebook.com/ImperialMemes](http://facebook.com/ImperialMemes)___
