Cakes as birthday presents are great – so quick, cheap and the effort everyone knows you went to means that even if you mess it up, people will pretend it tastes good. Fortunately, this recipe is virtually idiot-proof. Go ahead, test that statement.

Makes 1 small cake, for about 6 hungry people with dietary needs – but can be easily doubled!

_Vegan (dairy free) chocolate chips can be ordered online, or found in one of the many niche stores in London._

160g plain, gluten free flour
200g granulated sugar
50g cocoa powder
1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
1/2 tsp fine salt
235ml warm water
1 tsp vanilla extract
80ml neutral vegetable oil
1 tsp white wine vinegar
100g vegan chocolate chips
(if you can find them)

Preheat your oven to 180°C/160°C if using a fan oven. Grease/paper a 9” round cake pan, springform if you have it.

Sift together all the dry ingredients into a mixing bowl. If you don’t have a sieve, use the back of a spoon to carefully break up as many lumps as you can. In a jug, mix all the wet ingredients together. Pour the wet into the dry, using a whisk to combine – don’t dump all the liquid into the mix in one go, as you’ll end up with lumps. Use a spatula to mix in the chocolate chips, if using them, before transferring the mix to the pan.

Bake in your preheated oven for ~30 mins, when a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Leave to cool for an hour, then remove from the tin – a knife around the edge should help – before letting cool completely, if you can resist.
