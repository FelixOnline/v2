According to College medical researchers, statins have virtually no side effects.

In a recent study looking at 29 trials during which 80,000 patients took statins (cholesterol lowering drugs) the team concluded that a minority of side-effects were contributed by the drugs. Instead they found that patients were more likely to suffer serious side-effects from placebo pills in a control group than from statins.

The researchers from the National Heart and Lung Institute said that out of the side-effects that they monitored (including nausea, kidney disorder and muscular disease), the only side-effect that they could determine was an increased risk of diabetes, with 3% of subjects on statins being newly diagnosed with diabetes, in comparison to 2.4% of patients in the control group.
