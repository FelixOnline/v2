This is the penultimate issue of the term, we’ve only got one more until we break up for the Christmas holidays! Hurrah!
 In this weeks issue, Felix delves further into the problems with the government’s proposed Immigration Bill and we still await a decent response from Campus Services! Fun, fun, fun!
 The Immigration Bill is a serious issue that will affect a significant proportion of our students. It seems to have been poorly thought out by the government backers, since students are a significant proportion of the UK’s international population, you would have thought that the government would have taken more care when trying to make changes to the way immigrants are treated by the NHS and landlords in the UK.
 Similarly to the government, Felix is still concerned by the apparent disregard Campus Services has for it’s student stakeholders. Weeks away from the end of term and there has been no significant improvement in the cleaning provisions made for students. What this episode has highlighted is that some sections of College may seem (to some) to treat the students as objects that have no important views, rather than smart, rational adults that most of us (bar the odd few) are.
 Hopefully, within the next week we’ll see some real progress on both issues, with lots of new information being presented by both sides.
 Good luck with your assignments and marking, term is nearly over!
