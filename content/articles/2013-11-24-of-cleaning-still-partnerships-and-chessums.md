The recent cleaning response from Campus Services (see front page) indicates that some progress is being made in the ‘cleaning situation’. However, one wonders why the department has taken so long to give an apology, even if they’re only apologising for taking so long to provide adequate information to all hall residents. Felix would still like an answer to the list of questions we sent to them over seven days ago, we feel that the students should be getting some proper answers about the ways in which decisions were made that have a strong impact of their wellbeing and studying experience. Felix knows about at least one student who lives on a room where cleaning was not completed during the second rotation of the schedule, leaving the student to have a room that has only been cleaned once (so far) this term. While it is true that mistakes can be made (or possibly the room was particularly untidy) did Campus Services think about the repercussions it’s actions would have on the students, and indeed had the potential for these changes ever been discussed prior to the re-tender?
 Imperial has recently signed up to the Renaissance Engineering Programme with the Singaporean Nanyang Technological University. The program is shaped to create a kind-of engineering polymath, with bright students being educated in engineering, science, technology, business, economics, and entrepreneurship (College Joins NTU Renaissance Engineering Programme, page 3). This progressive programme seems like a fantastic opportunity for the students who will be selected and may leave some current students wishing they were only a few years younger...
 Oh, ULU, whatever next?
 As you may have heard in last week’s national papers, the President of the University of London Union, Michael Chessum was arrested the day after a protest he organised on University property. Following the controversy over Summer, where the University of London banned students from protesting on some areas of University property (see FelixOnline.co.uk on Aug 7th bit.ly/17S1ZrM), it seems as though the Union chose to ignore this warning while protesting about it’s immenent closure at the end of this academic year. While it is important that students stand up for their views, the low turnouts for ULU elections and the decent size of the UoL constituent College Unions, some might see the closue of ULU and the repurposing of its building by the University as a progessive move that might improve the efficiency of services for students.
