An annual walkathon to promote healthy living, jointly hosted by the [Imperial College London Diabetes Centre](http://www.icldc.ae/) (ICLDC) in Abu Dhabi and The National Health Insurance Company Daman, took place at the Yas Marina Circuit (the venue for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix) on November 25. [Walk For Life](http://www.diabetesuae.ae/walk_for_life), which is now in its fifth year, saw a turnout of up to 16,000, with over 45,000 having taken part in it since it began in 2007.

The event saw participants immersed in an afternoon of family entertainment that included a mix of musical acts as well as fun fitness activities, which culminated in a 5km walk undertaken by the participants.

Hosted under the patronage of Her Highness Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak, Walk For Life is part of ICLDC’s award-winning public health awareness campaign, “Diabetes-Knowledge-Action”, encouraging the public to take charge of their lifestyles. According to Dr Michael Bitzer, Daman’s Chief Executive Officer, Walk For Life “draws the attention of the nation to the importance of regular exercise as part of a healthy lifestyle practice”, alongside a healthy and balanced diet.

Meanwhile, ICLDC’s Medical and Research Director and Consultant Endocrinologist, Dr Maha Taysir, Barakat, spoke about the enormous health benefits of exercise. “A sedentary lifestyle and a poorly-balanced diet are likely to lead to excess body weight, which in turn can eventually manifest as Type 2 Diabetes,” she said.

The ICLDC is a state-of-the-art outpatient facility that specializes in diabetes treatment, research, training and public health awareness. Launched in August 2006, the centre was built by Mubadala Healthcare in partnership with Imperial College London. It has since offered diabetes prevention, education and treatment to more than 100,000 people.
