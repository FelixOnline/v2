Participation in SOLE shows that Earth Sciences once again has 100% participation rate, with the lowest being Biomedical Science at 34%.

Life Sciences also showed adisappointingly low 48% turnout.

This year the Department of Earth Sciences and Engineering piloted a scheme where you could fill out SOLE on the Imperial Mobile App available for smartphones.

Reasons to not fill out the survey range from apathy, not thinking people will listen or care, not being bothered, and exams meaning people don’t feel as though they have time to fill out the survey. There has also been the suggestion of survey fatigue amongst students.

Some Departments gave away prizes as an added incentive. Chemical Engineering and Aeronautical Engineering had a competition between years with prizes. Evidence suggested this worked to encourage students to fill out the survey as they had high participation rate.

Medicine is more complex, and, in general, had a very poor turnout.

With the SOLE survey being a way for Imperial College and Departments to gauge student opinion on lecturers and the course, getting as high a possible turnout is key to improving the course in line with students’ wants.
