Two Imperial professors have been recognised on the Queen’s Birthday Honours List, which was published last Saturday.

Professor Nigel Brandon, Director of Imperial’s [Energy Futures Lab](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/energyfutureslab), has been awarded an OBE alongside Professor Elisabeth Paice, Visiting Professor of the Professorial Department of Surgery.

Professor Brandon received his OBE for services to relations in science between the United Kingdom and China. Brandon has been a leading figure behind facilitating partnership between scientific communities in both the UK and China, resulting in collaborative projects between the two countries on the issue of clean and renewable energy.

Professor Paice was recognised for her services to Medicine. Paice has acted as Dean Director of Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education for North Thames from 1995 to 2001 and as Dean Director of London Deanery from 2001 until 2009. She developed a new educational commissioning system as Acting Director of Medical and Dental Education at NHS London from July 2009 until April 2010 and was named as NHS Mentor of the Year 2010 last December.
