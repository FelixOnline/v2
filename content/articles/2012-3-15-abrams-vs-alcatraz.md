Created by J.J. Abrams, the mastermind behind _[Lost](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411008/)_ and _[Fringe](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1119644/)_, _[Alcatraz](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1728102/)_ follows a special unit within the FBI dedicated to investigating the disappearance of the prisoners and guards from the infamous prison in 1963. The year is 2012 and the 63s, as they are commonly referred to, have started showing up the same age as when they disappeared and with no memory of how they vanished, or where they’ve been for the past 50 years.

Heading the investigation is Emerson Hauser, an FBI agent who also served as an officer on Alcatraz in the 60s. Played by Sam Neill (_Jurassic Park_), his main goal is to capture the convicts as they arrive in the present day, while also trying to figure out how they disappeared in the first place. His character is generally quite cynical with many hidden agendas. He is aided in his quest by Rebecca Madsen, an SFPD homicide detective with familial ties to Alcatraz. Jorge Garcia (_Lost_) rounds off the main cast as Dr Diego ‘Doc’ Soto, an author of books about Alcatraz and comic book shop owner. His in-depth knowledge of all of the inmates has proven invaluable and his character provides some much needed light-heartedness.

Voted as one of eight Most Exciting New Series, the show first aired in the US in January and has followed an ‘inmate-of-the-week’ format. Each episode therefore follows the team as they chase down the newest prisoner to return from who–knows–where, as well as showing flash-backs from said prisoner’s time at Alcatraz. The warden, deputy warden and head doctor at Alcatraz are crucial characters in these flashbacks, showing us that many of the guards were every bit as cruel and criminally inclined as the convicts themselves.
> Why and how did over 300 people disappear all at once?
After 10 episodes, we are still no closer to discovering the secrets behind Alcatraz. The plot is easy to follow, but each new episode brings up more questions. Background information about the main characters themselves is also quite scarce, but then it is still early days. So far it is clear that they all have a few skeletons in their closets. The disappearance seems scientific in its nature, with numerous references made to the works of _Jules Verne_. In typical J.J. fashion questions of morality and religion are investigated, whilst psychology and brain-washing also play an important role. Why and how did over 300 people disappear all at once? Where have they been and why do they have no memory of how it happened, yet know to look for certain objects hidden in various locations in San Francisco?

Being a great fan of _Lost_ and _Fringe_, I was excited to hear about Abrams’ new project. The element of time-travel was not at all surprising, but the idea behind it was something unique. The series is definitely entertaining to watch, but it lacks the punch and fast pace of his other shows. I guess the main issue I have thus far is how unconcerned everyone is with the fact that people are popping up from the past.

After an initial ‘is everyone else’s head exploding right about now’ moment in the first episode, Rebecca and Doc just take it at face value and stop questioning it. Even the inmates themselves don’t seem too concerned about suddenly finding themselves in the future and adapt to the present very quickly. I also question the inmates’ on-going compulsion to carry out the crimes they were originally caught and imprisoned for.

Despite these drawbacks, I still think Alcatraz is an enjoyable watch and I look forward to new episodes every week. It has all of the elements at hand to make it a great show. With only three more episodes until the end of the season, I’m sure the writers will keep us guessing at the ending.

_Alcatraz_ started airing on Watch this week. Catch it at 9pm on Tuesdays.
