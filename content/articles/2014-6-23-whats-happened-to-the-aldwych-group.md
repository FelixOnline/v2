[Tabloid Special]

As a group of representatives of the Student’s Unions and Associations of the Russell Group, you would expect them to be doing, well something. With an empty website and empty promises of meeting at least 6 times a year, rumours have been spreading amongst the twittersphere that the group may be disbanding.

When approached to comment on the situation, or really lack of situation, the Aldwych group declined to reply, which makes us wonder whether there’s actually anyone at the other end of the computer.

The pristinely made website that has pretty much no content apart from a long list of bullet points about the Constitution along with no press releases, new updates or events, its no wonder that the group may be scrapped and sold for parts.

Perhaps the Aldwych group will step up its game with the new prospect of Oxford joining the non-NUS affiliates club or perhaps they’ll do what they are good at doing, which is nothing.

Either way, it’s clear that this group either need to step up their game or step out of the game.
