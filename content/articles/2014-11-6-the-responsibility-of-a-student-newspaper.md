This week, another rugby team has been suspending following another stint of bad behaviour. Although this lessened the logistics of arranging our front page (literally, we could have just changed the name of the team from last week’s issue), it is becoming a much more difficult topic for us, as a student paper, to report on.

We are aware that these stories have the potential to go national and therefore bring disrepute onto Imperial College and Imperial College Union as a result. We are also aware that it could have an impact on those involved, who, although have remained nameless, may be affiliated with the club.

As an independent paper, we can’t refuse to cover stories that are of the public interest. We also can’t be told what stories we shouldn’t cover either by the Union or the College. We are lucky that both have been understanding of this and co-operative, a privilege many other student papers don’t enjoy.

Student Unions at other institutions have a habit of meddling with student newspapers, and can reduce them down to an extension of their publicity material if they are too careless. The papers cease to function as intended, and harm the development of the journalistic skillset of the students involved with the publications and also the quality of the paper as a whole.

It also makes the whole thing a lot less fun and a lot more laborious for us.

We are always keen to put across the student’s side of the story, as we are students too. Although it may be easier and simpler to let the Union release a statement on your behalf, if you find yourself under scrutiny from a student media outlet, do try to put forward your take on the events too. It might be the only chance you get, as the national media may not be as kind.

A prime example of this is the story we’ve also covered this week of _The Sun_ looking to pay student papers for incriminating photos of Halloween costumes this year.

Again, students “misbehaving” generate interest, clicks, and money.

We have sadder news this week, about the passing of a student this week. We offer our condolences to the family and friends of Tian Wei Chew.

We also have some great student news in this week’s issue too. Our iGEM team came second in their global synthetic biology competition, which is outstanding.

Therefore it’s a mixed bag of an issue this week. Read on and then let us know what you think.
