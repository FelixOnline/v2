###  The Whistleblower

__Director __Larysa Kondracki
__Screenwriter__ Larysa Kondracki
__Cast __Rachel Weisz, David Strathairn, Monica Bellucci, Vanessa Redgrave

Why this important, superior thriller only made the direct-to-DVD release is anyone’s guess but The Whistleblower, one woman’s quest for justice in which she has to go after a powerful group of individuals, may sound familiar and predictable, but anchored by a strong lead performance, assured direction and a solid script, is an unmissable treat.

Based on a true story (aren’t they always?), we first meet Kathryn Bolkovac (Weisz), a Nebraska cop, as she takes on a job for Democra Corp, an American private military company, to travel to post-war Bosnia, where she is to assist the peace-keeping operations overseen by the United Nations.

Although this new opportunity is well-paid and filled with excitement at first, she soon uncovers a major sex-trafficking ring in which even underage girls are forced into prostitution. At first, Bolkovac only suspects the local police and the military of being responsible. But as she digs deeper, she discovers a long list of clientele that includes names of high-level diplomats, as well as those employed in the U.N.
 Bolkovac is far from perfect, and is way in over her head trying to tackle the world’s biggest, most respected organisation. But the one thing she knows better than anyone is right and wrong. Rape is wrong. Human trafficking is wrong.

Weisz, in one of her most unforgettable performances, is masterful in balancing the many complex emotions of her character as she is put through all sorts of obstacles. Compassion and anger are what drive our heroine; the former for the abused girls, and the latter towards the high-power officials arrogant and corrupt enough to believe that they can get away with anything.

What sets The Whistleblower apart from similar themed films is how personal and sensitive the film’s narrative is. Bolkovac travels alone, mostly in the dark, risking her life in order to finish what she rightfully started. By using her vulnerability, it reels you in, and is more than effective in setting up a cruel, menacing atmosphere of the real world. And being such a character-driven drama, it walks that fine line of addressing the important key issues with confidence and passion, all the while not succumbing to too much preachy tone. It has a gentle, well-balanced mix of drama and thriller, in which neither aspect is overplayed. It’s a much-needed wake-up call for us all, reminding us of the world we live in.

_The Whistleblower is released on January 16_
