__Italian Elections Heat Up__

On the 9th of December Mario Monti, Italy’s “technocrat” leader, stepped down amid a boycott by Berlusconi’s Freedom People party over budget decisions. Appointed after Berlusconi lost his parliamentary majority and resigned amongst personal scandals, Monti’s government was tasked with balancing Italy’s books before stepping down this April; his early resignation has pushed the Italian elections forward to February..

Silvio Berlusconi had already confirmed his intention to run for a fourth term in upcoming elections, but it remained uncertain what Monti would do; this was mirrored in the markets, with fears over Italy becoming “the detonator that could blow up the eurozone”.
 Now it’s been announced that Monti will run supported by a coalition of centrist parties under the name “Monti’s Agenda for Italy”, though as a result of his austerity policies the group currently trail far behind Pier Bersani’s centre-left Democratic Party.

__Syria Conflict Deepens__

The Syrian conflict remains decidedly unresolved, now being deemed an all out civil war. Recent estimates from the UN have put the total death toll from the conflict at 60,000 since it began some 22 months ago, as much as half of which are estimated to be civilian deaths. Ten times as many people are now registered as refugees in neighbouring countries.
 Many cities such as Aleppo and Homs remain the site of intense fighting between government forces and the increasingly internationally accepted National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces. However the vast majority of the capital, Damascus, is still held by forces loyal to Bashar Al-Assad, save the suburb of Douma held by rebels since October 18th.

__Europe Debate Rolls On__

Here in the UK, debate over the country’s role in the European Union and single-market has continued at a low key rumble. David Cameron is due to announce his ‘action plan’ on Europe in weeks. But he has been warned by various figures including the Obama Administration that withdrawal would risk damaging the UK’s political significance and economic power. An In/Out referendem seems unlikely, but it’s possible Britain will push to renegotiate it’s “role” within the union. How that will be received by other members remains to be seen.
