Imperial College describe the Fringe as “a series of public events exploring the unexpected side of science”, and like the Edinburgh Fringe, and other events with this name, there is a focus on the stranger side the field it covers; in this instance, academic research.

The Imperial Fringe is part of the new Imperial Festival, which launched last year with a two-day show of what Imperial College does, aimed at the general public. The Imperial Fringe, however, has a slightly different remit, looking at specific scientific topics inspired by research currently being undertaken by Imperial researchers.

Fringe events appear to be monthly, with events for both this and next month announced, though dates for future talks up to and including March have also been given.

Topics for the events currently include the study of how the brain works and fear, as well as another on bones and the latest ‘groundbreaking’ research currently being undertaken by Imperial researchers in this area.

Attendance is free and is open to students, staff, and the general public, and no registration is necessary. A pay bar is open all evening.

More information can be found on the Imperial website, at http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/festival/fringe.
