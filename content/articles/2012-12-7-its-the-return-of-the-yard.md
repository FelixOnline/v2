Paul Beaumont, Union President, has proposed a new “Retailing of Alcohol” policy to the Executive Committee (Exec.), which will change the bar opening hours and yards.

The bar will now have to remain open until the advertised closing time (which is section 5 of the policy).
 Yards, as mentioned above, will also be affected. This is the largest insertion into the policy. It will mean that they are allowed and it sets out the process for doing yards. The procedure will be how it has been ever since they were brought back – yards were banned for a short period of time.

The policy was one of Beaumont’s manifesto points and he said that he wanted to “review it whilst remaining within the law and the spirit of thelaw”.

The Alcohol Policy Committee was something that was put in place in 2010 by the DPFS of the time, but,technically, it was breaking the Constitution (the document that governs the rules by which the Union is to be run). It contravened the Constitution by having staff on a committee, which is prohibited, and so, is now gone.
