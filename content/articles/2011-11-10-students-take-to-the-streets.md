Just under a year on from the first major student demonstration against education cuts, Wednesday 9 November saw students from across the country arrive in central London to continue the protest against higher tuition fees. Departing from Malet Street, the protesters marched on a route that led through Trafalgar Square on their way to the City of London. Approximately 4000 officers were on duty, with the march being largely controlled. Though approximately 20 people were arrested, the protest was a largely peaceful event, in contrast with the events of November 10 2011, which saw protestors occupy Millbank Tower. __Photography by Tommy Allieri__
