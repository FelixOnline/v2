I hope you’re as excited for Imperial’s ski trip as we are. It’s already snowing in the Alps and with the booking deadline (9th November) fast approaching it’s time to book on! Last year we sold out a week early and places are going fast so don’t hesitate and put your deposit down now!

From the 14th - 22nd December, we’ll be heading to Val Thorens to hit the slopes and the apres ski, with hundreds of other students from London unis as part of the London Snowoperative. Base price is £329 which includes transport, accommodation and lift pass. This is our cheapest trip yet.

Val T has got it all, with over 600km of piste to choose from as well as an insane night life! We have parties scheduled every night with the other London students. There’s a huge opening and closing party and on Wednesday night we have drum and bass big-dog Danny Byrd from Hospital Records headlining with free entry to anyone on our trip!

To book, you need to buy your Snowsports membership for the year at: <https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/shop/club-society-project-products/snowsports-products/234/snowsports-membership-12/13> Then, go to <https://accounts.nucotravel.com/create> and create an account. Book on the Imperial London SnowOp holiday at: https://booking.nucotravel.com/sy/londonsnowop

It doesn’t matter if you’ve never skied before - there’ll be people of all abilities going. And yes, you can bring friends from other unis by buyingassociate membership of the Union for December at <https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/your-union/how-were-run/membership>. See you on the slopes!
