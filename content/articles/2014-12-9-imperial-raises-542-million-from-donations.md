On the 25th of November, Imperial College London hosted a Thank You Reception in celebration of the record-breaking number of donations made to the College during 2013-2014. Part of the donations, which totalled £54.2 million, went towards funding 110 undergraduate scholarships through the President’s Scholarship Fund, which consists of a £3,000 reward. The fund also supported the Imperial College PhD Scholarship Scheme, which cover full tuition fees as well as additional financing for three and a half years.

During the year, 5,403 donors gave money for research and scholarships.

President Alice Gast hosted the event, along with other Imperial staff and students. During a welcome speech, President Gast remarked that support for university education had never been more important than now, placing an emphasis on the need for people to be able to problem-solve and think critically to address the dynamic problems we face today. She said: ‘Today’s world demands new leaders, critical thinkers, fresh ways of approaching persistent problems, and innovative ways of handling the new problems that arise. This is what we do here at Imperial – we develop thinkers and leaders, we extend knowledge and develop solutions. And we can do all this only because of your continued support – the support of our donors.”

The President’s Scholar, 4th year physicist Oliver Clipsham, also spoke of the benefits of the scholarship scheme at the event. He said: “On behalf of myself and all the scholars here at Imperial, I would like to offer my heartfelt thanks that you have donated to ensure that more students may go on to have a similarly wonderful experience.”

The event also saw the launch of the 1907 Circle, which recognises the people and organisations who donate £5,000 or more to Imperial. Those who are members of the Circle are given a lapel pin in commemoration, a personal report giving a break down of the impact of their donation, and an invitation to every special event hosted by President Gast. Last month, more than 80 people joined the Circle.

The evening saw the Queen’s Tower Rooms transformed into an exhibition hall, with interactive stands presenting information about the cutting-edge research taking place at Imperial.

Alumni from around the world descended on campus to attend the event. Dr. Michael McCann, who did a PhD in Electrical Engineering at Imperial in 1963, visited from the US. He has supported scholarships at the College for a long time, and his motivation for donating stems from the importance of education in building a successful career.

He said ‘My PhD has been the key to everything I’ve done professionally.”
