     For one Laurence to another - bravo. You echo my equally joyous thoughts over this pinnacle of engineering perfectly.,I have been dreading the thought of going back to Imperial after a year abroad, but this has changed everything...,When the new front was first put on the library a few years ago they had to put up signs warning people not to touch the metal (ie. the entire front wall) in the summer as it got so hot it could burn you. Nice touch. ,Everyone knows the doors are just a way of making people walk through the Café to boost sales.,Now THIS is satire. ,There I was, expecting another humdrum Friday morning, yet lo and behold, one of the doors was closed for maintenance – again! <br> <br>I do love it when they keep you on your toes.,I had to force my way in the other day by tearing apart the doors - a deliberate, poignant and necessary reminder of the dangers of over-reliance on technology ,One of the main points, during the viability study, was to see if we could trip up as many of the users who sneak in

The new Library entrance was today unveiled in what is already being called a stunning coup for students. The entrance, which whilst still in the same place, now encompasses an incredible 3.75m2, will provide untold numbers with easier access to Imperial’s coveted study areas.

It will certainly be a relief to many students to find that the outrageous ‘face-on’ style previously employed has been scrapped in favour of two, more acceptable, side entrances. “Frankly, I was this close to writing a letter of complaint about the positioning of the entrance – it was really dangerous and offensive” said one student who wished to remain anonymous.

As well as its clear benefits to students’ comfort and safety, the entrance will also encourage more students to use the facilities contained within. “I never used the library before, but I’ll certainly consider it now,” said another student before adding, “although I’m not sure what I’d do once inside”.

Not only does the new entrance represent an unheralded show of good will by Imperial College towards its students, but the building work was impeccably timed. The decision to start building in the winter months during term time was, without a doubt, not straightforward. However it was entirely vindicated as students were finally able to appreciate some of the behind-the-scenes work that goes into making Imperial tick. Sure, the library café was cold enough to make the crew of [_Frozen Planet_](http://felixonline.co.uk/tv/1739/frozen-planet--a-true-masterpiece/) think twice about eating there and more crowded than most places are legally allowed to be, but there was strong positive feedback from interviewed students indicating that the timing of construction really made them feel looked after.

Students from the Life Sciences appeared to be amongst the happiest at the sight of the entrance. The department underwent [serious perestroika last year](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/557/disappointment-as-senate-sides-with-life-sciences-cuts/) resulting in excellent lecturers losing their jobs and many students feeling betrayed by their university; however, reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. “At first I was doubtful that a new entrance could repair the cracks created by the restructuring process, but now I’ve seen the entrance myself, it’s certainly worth three or four good lecturers” said 2nd year biochemist Lee Sewell.

With this kind of investment in students, Imperial will surely look forward to rocketing up the student satisfaction rankings for 2012.
