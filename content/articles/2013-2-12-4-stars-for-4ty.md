A follow-up to Knocked Up without actually holding onto any of its main characters, we instead have a closer look at how aged, mature relationships work, and in this case, how the “happily ever after” is much easier said than done.

Debbie (Mann) is 40 now although she would never admit it. Impromptu shower-sex with her husband Pete (Rudd) on her birthdayseemed all great to start with, until she discovers he took some viagra beforehand. “I don’t want a turbo penis. I like your medium soft one” she says, with great disappointment.

And so begins Apatow’s portrayal of gradual marital decline as well as his excellent gags and one-liners. Whether the film itself closely follows what Apatow may be going through in real-life we’ll never know, but the use of his actual wife (Mann) and their children (Maude and Iris) seems to suggest there is an element of truth.

Aside from the lack of spice in their marriage, the family faces financial difficulties, stemming mostly from Pete’s record company that is not doing well in the modern market, as well as Debbie’s struggling jewellery store where she suspects one of her employees (Fox and Yi) is stealing from her. Pete’s father (the excellent Albert Brooks) is also constantly on the prowl, asking his son for more money, whereas Debbie’s wealthy but awkward father Oliver (John Lithgow) makes things tougher.

It offers no great original wisdom on how a marriage should work, and despite pondering on the question for over two hours (a long running time that is occasionally felt), it goes down the traditional corny route that involves a seemingly random accident that makes everyone realise just how much they love each other. Hurrah.

But Apatow is no amateur when it comes to writing the gags and finding the right people to deliver them. There are plenty of hysterical moments, along with some exceptional cameo appearances.
