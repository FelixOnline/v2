Wondering what games to play this summer? Here’s two great and perhaps unussual suggestions to get you started.

The first of the two games is Grand Theft Auto Four. Yes, four not five! Whilst five is the new better looking, bigger, better GTA there are reasons why four should not be forgotten. The main thing is the story. GTA 5 has an impressive and long story to complete but often times I felt it was easy and too cinematic. A great story but once I’d played through it there was no rush to replay the missions other than to get gold rating. GTA 4 also has a long story mode with the missions being less cinematic on the most part and harder. The story isn’t the beautiful piece of cinema that five offers but it is still very strong and is worth a replay to people who already played it. Through the two excellent expansions the game actually offers three stories, each giving Liberty city a whole new feel. It’s not the character switching madness of five but it is three characters each with their own personality and mission themes. If you really want something to do this summer you could go for GTA4 100% which is an impressive feat and will take much longer than GTA5 100% which doesn’t actually require you to complete everything in the game.

In all honesty both games, or any GTA game, would make an entertaining summer playthrough and I just wanted to remind people that GTA4 exists. GTA5 does have GTA online and planes going for it both of which are loads of fun and will keep you entertained all summer.

My second recomendation is the fantastic game Goat Simulator. After playing a variety of simulator games this year from Euro Bus Simulator 2 to Surgeon Simulator I have finally found the greatest Simulator game of them all! Goat Simulator strays away from traditional simulator games such as Euro Bus and more towards the comedy side. The world of goat simulator reminds me of a level from a Tony Hawk game except your goal is just to destroy everything in your path. The mechanics of the game are simple, you are a goat who can attach yourself to things with your infinitely long, flexible, strong tongue. You can jump and change your orientation in the air to perform backflips and such. With such easy controls we get a game that is suitable for all ages and all levels of gaming ability. Whether you just want to waste twenty minutes destroying the world as a goat or if you are a completionist who will find every secret, complete every quest and achieve every achievement Goat Simulator will not disappoint.
