__Indoor Cricket__

_Imperial 128-3 Bournemouth 95 all out_

_Imperial 121-2 Bournemouth 24 all out_

On October 22 the ICU Women’s cricket team participated in the BUCS Women’s Indoor Cricket Championships held at Fleming Park Leisure Centre in Southampton. After a two hour drive we looked forward to a day of action packed cricket!

In this regional tournament we were one of four teams alongside UCL, Southampton University and Bournemouth University. Our squad consisted of seasoned players Priya Patel (captain), Priya Shah, Celeste van den Bosch and Mithila Patkunan (wicketkeeper); and new comers Natalie Jones, Mitali Mishra and Taniya Parikh. Special thanks go to Siddharth Kohli who acted as our coach and scorer. The full worth of his pre-match training session and tips was revealed when Priya S took a brilliant catch off the wall!

ICU Women’s Cricket team beat Bournemouth University (twice) to progress through to the finals at Lord’s.

We played two matches, of 12 overs each, both against Bournemouth. We won by 33 runs in the first match and a resounding 97 in the second. Celeste shone in the first match scoring 22 runs and picking up 4 wickets. In the second match a fantastic bowling attack led by Priya S caused the opposition to be dismissed for a mere 24 runs in 4 overs.

The women’s team is now preparing for the finals which will take place on January 25th at Lord’s! Even though they’ll be up against some tough competition from Exeter, Bristol, Southampton, Birmingham and Loughborough who have also reached the final, the challenge is eagerly awaited. We will be practising hard in nets until then. If you’re interested in joining us, we’d love to hear from you so drop us a line.
