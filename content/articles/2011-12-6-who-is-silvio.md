Who is Silvio? What is he,
 That all our swines commend him?
 Wholly full of vice is he;
 The seven such place did lend him,
 That he might removed be.

Is he blind to his hair?
 For arrogance lives with blindness.
 Sloth doth to his mind repair,
 To help him of his spineless,
 And being helped, inhabits there.

Then to Silvio let us sing,
 That Silvio is expelling;
 He excels each immoral thing
 Upon the good earth dwelling:
 To him let his bungas swing.
