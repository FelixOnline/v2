Life drawing is an activity that a lot of people would like to do, but sometimes don’t dare to. For some, the nudity and sterility of classical art classes and the applied attention of overly zealous pseudo-artists in the room can be very intimidating, or maybe simply boring. But rejoice, as a new, alternative drawing movement has brought Dr. Sketchy to life – and to London!

Anti-art school promoting art for the sake of art and fun, Dr. Sketchy started in New-York in 2005 as the brainchild of Molly Crabapple. Dr. Sketchy events, which have included illegal flashmobs to the Museum of Modern Art, take the snobbism out of art to make it available and entertaining, to really ignite the creativity in everyone. It allows you to release the artist in you, whether you’re picking up a pen for the first time or you’ve just graduated from the Royal Academy. It mixes life drawing with burlesque and cabaret performances, in a familiar and relaxed setting – where drinks and cocktails can abound. It is simply the coolest art class you’ll ever go to.

In London since 2007, Dr. Sketchy has now nested at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, an institution hailed best cabaret venue in 2012 by the London Cabaret Awards (yes there is such a thing!). It is an intimate and well-designed space for performances, allowing the audience to grab a drink and get comfortable before the entertainment starts.

Last Wednesday June 19th, we first had the chance to hear Frankie Von Flirter’s melodious voice enchant us, as she glamorously stripped from her evening gown. It was quite hard to decide whether to just look and listen, or to try to draw the scene… Millie Dollar then stepped in for a go-go dance and some spectacular nipple tassels spinning. Last, Frankie von Flirter came back with a humorous version of Top Gun’s best tracks, which turned into a cheeky duet finale with the two performers. After each act, the artists also pose and allow us to liberate our drawing spirits, which have been loosened by a few drinks. To my surprise, the performers are not only talented, but also professional when modelling for the crowd. Soon the suaveness of the acts resides, the attraction of nakedness subsides and the audience is fully absorbed in furiously scribbling to capture the forms on stage.

Com-pair Ebenezer Valentine smoothens the tone of the evening and gives amusing challenges to the spectators – add a monkey in your drawing now! – as well as little prizes (mostly lollies) for the most original pieces and interesting behaviours. No need to get your proportions right, or for your drawings to be life-like; what we’re looking for is any kind of innovative genius. Between each act you have the time to chat with your neighbours, grab another drink, or just hang out to the great soundtrack of the DJ, who encourages you to get your groove on throughout the evening. To my experienced eye, jaded by a lot of the pretend alternative events happening in London, Dr. Sketchy offers an out of the ordinary evening, without the pretention.

With only another event scheduled in the calendar this summer, you better book your £10 tickets in advance for the July 20th class. Check the website for details at <http://www.drsketchylondon.co.uk>
