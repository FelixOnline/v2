Before stepping up for this role earlier this year, I tried to look for the Disabilities Officer at the time to ask for some advice. I discovered, after three days of searching, that no one ran in the elections, so the position was not filled. Even though this position seems niche in the Imperial community, it is extremely important for those who need it and for those who may not know that help is there, I found this to be disappointing. This was one of the main reasons I ran. I really want to create a supportive environment and maximise inclusivity and integration. As well as attempt to change the culture about disabilities in the Imperial and wider community.

It is such a critical and hopeful time for those with disabilities, as the White City campus shows great potential for a more accessible environment and better services. I recently went to look around the new campus to ensure that we have the best possible facilities to meet the needs of everyone.

It is important to raise awareness about disabilities within the student body, as well as with staff. This provides people who have not had as much experience with disabilities an insight into the variety of disabilities, as well as the needs of those affected. Thus I have been organising many events for Disability History Month (22nd November to 22nd December), which display the difficulties faced by Imperial students on a daily basis. The events vary from disability sports events to British Sign Language workshops, as well as information stalls and talks! And we need your help â€“ you can volunteer for the events here: https://goo.gl/ysTtBi
