Yes, the day of reckoning is upon us. Global productivity has come to a standstill. These are the news headline that will echo around the world on the day of the release of _Fallout 4_.

If you have spent any time on the internet in the past week, you know that __Bethesda __has made a good attempt at breaking it! After putting up a countdown about a week ago, Bethesda then released the trailer to the newest installment in the Fallout series.

For all of you who don’t know what _Fallout_ is; _Fallout _is a RPG game set in a post apocalyptic which has been ravaged by a nuclear war. These games revolve around you the protagonist trying to survive this harsh wasteland. The games themselves originated from a text-based game to a full sandbox game with RPG and FPS elements. Basically, imagine _Skyrim_ with technology in post-apocalyptic America, but better.

Sadly, the last Fallout game was _Fallout: New Vegas_, which was announced in 2010, almost 5 years ago. So now, out of the blue (ok fine, there have been several hints here and there, but nothing really solid) to get this is pretty neat. The trailer itself has that same Fallout feel as previous installments, with the 40s, 50s style music and retro futuristic design. We follow a dog, as he explores an abandoned house, getting the occasional flashback to the better, more hopeful time before the nuclear war. We then are treated to a view of a ravaged and destroyed Boston where the game will take place, followed by scenes of feral ghouls and even a return of Deathclaw, a villain from the previous games. Furthermore, we are given the number of the vault that it seems our main character comes from, namely 111 (which also happens to be binary for seven which is pretty cool since this is the seventh game in the series!).

There is no real further information from the game, but if you can’t hold in your excitement there are several analysis videos of the trailer that are trying to glean as much information from it as possible. Most people are hoping for more information, including a release date, at E3 which is in about a week. However, what we do know is that the game will be available on Xbox One, PS4 and PC, so if you still own the old generation of consoles it may be time to update!

I have to say that I am really, really excited for this game. There hasn’t been any really good post-apocalyptic games like _Fallout_ in a while (_DayZ_ and all the zombie games didn’t really live up to their hype), so I really can’t wait to unpack my vault boy, gorge on some nuke cola and explore the destroyed land that is post-nuclear america.
