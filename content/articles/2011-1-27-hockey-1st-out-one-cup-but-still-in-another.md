This week saw the hockey mens 1st XI in action twice, both in cup matches. As holders of the ULU challenge cup, IC were hoping to retain the trophy this season, but received a tough draw against this seasons form side, UCL, in the quarter finals. Imperial showed plenty of ability, but some defensive mistakes and some missed chances saw us crash out of the ULU cup, eventually losing 6 – 4 in a fast, open game, where attack was the only form of defence for both sides.

IC took heart from their Sunday game, but started poorly against GKT, and were 1 – 0 down at half time, causing legendary first team coach Avtar to swear for the first time in living memory. After some relentless metaphors, IC improved after the break, and showed real character and patience, eventually breaking the deadlock midway through the second half with some inspired play by creative playmaker Tom Koch. At 1-1, all was to play for, and the game opened up, leading to goals on both sides, with fresher sam scoring his first goal at Imperial, and captain Yogi finding the net despite having his dislocated finger reset twice this week.

With 5 minutes to go, IC went 3-2 in front, and looked to have sealed a victory, when a last minute breakaway gave GKT a controversial penalty corner seconds before the final whistle. With all their men up, GKT managed to convert the corner courtesy of a baseball style shot as the ball rebounded. Three all at full time meant extra time was to follow.

Vowing to continue in the same vein, IC went into extra time confident that they could find a goal, but after being reduced to 10, and then 9 players courtesy of some debateable yellow cards, the first half of extra time was goalless. When IC returned to full strength, they were dominant, and creative playmaker Tom Koch once again found some magic, sealing the victory with an outstanding golden goal, with 2 minutes of extra time remaining.

IC go into this weekend’s BUCS league match with Holloway full of confidence that they can turn around a disappointing start to the season on the back of the fantastic BUCS cup win.
