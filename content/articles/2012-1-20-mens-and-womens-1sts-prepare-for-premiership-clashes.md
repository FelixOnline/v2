The Imperial fencing men’s and women’s teams stand to win their respective leagues this weekend, the men’s and women’s Southern Premiership, if they can fight off the likes of Oxford, Cambridge, and London rivals such as Queen Mary or ULU.

The women’s team currently stand top of the southern premiership, having won all of their matches in the previous weekend tournament held in Cambridge. Their closest competition is Oxford, who won three out of four. Nevertheless, the girls registered a convincing win against the dark blues last time round, and expect to do so again this weekend. Captained by ISE undergrad Charlotte Levin, and featuring GB hopeful and Sports scholarship athlete Hannah Bryars, the team hope to defend last year’s crown successfully.

The men face a slightly more challenging task, but are still feeling confident they can come top of the league. They currently stand in second place, having lost to Oxford in the first weekend tournament by a single hit.

Captain Didier Nohlmans, a Physics PhD student, believes they can definitely beat Oxford (and the rest of the teams) this time, which would ensure the IC contingent finish in first place. The men’s team are buoyed by the strength of their sabreurs Maiyuran Ratneswaran and Henry Gann, 6th and 12th respectively in the GB rankings.

If both teams retain their league titles, it will be another feather in the cap of the Imperial fencing club, currently the most successful in the country – both the women’s and men’s 1st are defending BUCS champions.

The matches will take place in Ethos on Saturday and Sunday; come down and support the team!
