 - Seriously This is the only thing Ive heard Massie do all year and lets be honest its a complete load of bollocks Maybe he should spend less time with miss palm and her five children and more time doing his jobIn a week where you would expect your student representative to actually do some work This week is Eating Disorders Awareness Week the only substance cuming from the office of our DPW is uncertainty about the boundaries of the road on the west side particularly the tactile borders When there are way more important issues in the country to campaign about I begin to loose faith FFS theres even a banner about LGBT month yet another week of welfare is missed by MassieHow the student body accepts the colossal waste of money that is a sabbatical salary in such an absent representative is beyond me Then again the only people who can do anything about it are most likely part of the inner circle constructed by incestuous Union poloticsIm not even going to try and post as just ano

[In a paper](http://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/data/files/imperial-college-union-stance-on-exhibition-road-3971.pdf) brought to Union Council on Monday 13 February by Deputy President (Welfare) Nicolas Massie, the Union proposed to lobby Westminster City Council about multiple concerns with [the new Exhibition Road layout](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/2121/exhibition-road-closes-for-grand-opening-/). The paper pointed out the “uncertainty about the boundaries of the road on the west side, particularly the tactile borders”.

It went on to point out that the “use of the ‘roundabout’ (Prince Consort Road and Exhibition Road) is unclear and has increased the risk to cyclists”.

When even the Union begins to use quotation marks, everyone can rest assured it’s absurd.

The ‘roundabout’ in question is located outside the Business School. This is, unlike every other roundabout, just a crossroads with a circle painted on it. The paper also raised concerns over the “800 metres [of Exhibition Road] without assisted crossing”.

The paper was ultimately passed, and it was decided that the Union should lobby Westminster City Council to clarify several points, including “whether it is a shared space”. Another issue to be lobbied for is to put up signs informing people of the rules of the road.
