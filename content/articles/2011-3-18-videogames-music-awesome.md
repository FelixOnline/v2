Have you ever felt like going to a pub, having a couple of pints, playing some old style video games and hanging out with friends? Yes? Well, you’re not alone. Two guys, Nicholas Thurgood (Nicky) and David Lightfoot (Dave), have just started running a monthly event called Nintendisco. The basic idea is to get people together and hang out in a bar, and then play videogames together, whilst listening to music, from contemporary radio hits to video game theme tunes!

Nicky and Dave have both been gaming fans since they were kids. Dave’s first console was a [48k Spectrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum) that he shared together with his brother, and this is what started his lifelong passion. From this starting point, both guys spent time in signed, touring bands before joining the two interests together and starting Nintendisco. They explain that they “wanted to combine our live musical/promoting experience with our love for games and make an event that everyone could enjoy. Sort of like gaming karaoke, or watching a football match on a big screen, but watching a round of Mario Kart instead.” As a start-up, they spent some time going through different games, looking for retro, fun and accessible games that could work well on a big screen.

The first event was at the [Lock Tavern](http://lock-tavern.co.uk/) in Camden. Nicky and Dave were at first worried about how many people would show up, being unsure of people’s interest. It turned out to be the least of their worries, and they moved to a larger venue: [93 Feet East](http://www.93feeteast.co.uk/) on Brick Lane. This is where they held their 5th, and latest, event. It’s still a fairly small pub, with some leather sofas spread around, a DJ podium in one of the corners and the screen on the wall facing the entrance. The atmosphere is laid back, two players at a time sitting down on one of the sofas and by the podium the hosts take turns in presenting the players and commentating on the game. To get to play you hand in a piece of paper with your name and which game you would prefer to play, e.g. Super Mario Kart or Street Fighter. They recommend you hand in the paper fairly early to make sure you get to play, a challenge that has turned out to be much bigger than getting people to the venue. To make sure that there isn’t one person dominating all night long, there is a small prize ceremony after a certain number of victories; how many depending on the game being played. During the ceremonies, the Star Wars Imperial March soundtrack plays in the background and the winner is placed on a podium where he receive a small gold medal and a t-shirt.

If this is something that interests you, the next event will take place 28th April. Although, already next week, on the 24th March, Nintendisco will be a part of the launch event for Nintendo 3DS. Instead of focusing on their regular old school games only, they will hold a 3D Tournament, but still play the mixture of Nintendo sounds and contemporary music. This launch event is at HMV Oxford Street (Oxford St, London W1A 1AB), so why not celebrate end of term but getting together a bunch of friends and challenge each other on video games?
