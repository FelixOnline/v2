FINANCE

Last week, Huffington Post published an article ranking the most expensive universities to live and study at in the UK. The universities were ranked in terms of their total cost of living over three years.

The cost for Imperial came to £53,822. UCL was the second most expensive university and LSE was the most expensive at £59,152.

DISABILITIES

The Assistive technology suite in the Disabilities centre closed down last Friday, a new room will open in the library this year. There will be a Assistive Technology room in the library that will be open till the new centre opens.

Imperial has also made Mindview (a mind-mapping program) and Claro-read available to every student at Imperial for campus use.

SCIENCE

Researchers at Imperial are working on a designer protein to treat prostrate cancer when other therapies are unsuccessful.

In the lab, this protein has obstructed the growth of cancer cells even when other therapeutic methods have failed. These results were published in the journal Oncotarget this week.

About 37,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year, and 11,000 men die from it on a yearly basis.
