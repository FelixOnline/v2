I'm not sure if [My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy](http://open.spotify.com/album/6LBiuhK7PZKjVXyMfPxPoh) is my favourite album (it's probably close) but since [Pitchfork officially rated it 'perfect'](http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14880-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy/), it's probably as good a choice as any.

The London Student and Felix are [currently fighting an epic war](http://felixonline.co.uk/music/1210/london-student-vs-felix-30-day-challenge/).
