The first riding team have moved into first place in their league after an impressive win in Buckinghamshire on Wednesday. Picking up individual 1st 3rd and 7th places, Rachel Gregory, Ilse daly, Sinead Conneely and Mikaela Bryant-Meisner are now in a favourable position with two competitions left, one being their home event at Trent Park in Oakwood.

The morning got off to a cold start with snow still on the ground at Snowball Park when the show jumping started. After 16 rounds on some horses who weren’t so keen on keeping the fences up Imperial college had a 30 point lead, with Gregory and Daly holding joint first individually.

The dressage horses proved to be even more difficult to handle than the showjumpers but the team held their own, extending their lead to 49 points at the end of the day. Gregory finished up with zero penalties to take the overall win, an impressive result as today’s judge noted that this year the competition showcased some of the highest standard of riding she’s seen at University level.
