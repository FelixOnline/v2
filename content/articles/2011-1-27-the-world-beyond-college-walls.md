Palestine

Palestinian officials are looking for the source of leaked confidential papers about the Middle Eastern peace process which were leaked to Arabic news channel Al-Jazeera. Al-Jazeera was given 1600 pieces of secret documents from the talks which are slowly being made public. Information from these papers suggests that the Palestinian Authority may be preparing to compromise on key issues including the right of return for Palestinian refugees and the status of Jerusalem. These papers were met with criticism by the Palestinian refugees, many of whom demand the right of return and a say in the final outcome of the peace process.

Russia

Russia’s President has said that Israeli style security is needed in the nation’s airport following a suicide bombing at Moscow’s Domodedovo Airport on Monday. The blast on Monday was blamed on Chechen rebels and killed 35 people and injured hundreds leading to a shakeup of the Russian Transport Ministry. Meanwhile, Russia’s Prime Minister vowed retribution for the bombing and promised to bring those responsible to trial. Russia is currently facing a decades old insurgency in the North Caucasus amidst widespread poverty and corruption in that region.

Sudan

President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan has pledged to support South Sudan in his first address since the referendum held two weeks ago. Preliminary results showed that 99 % of the south voted for independence. President al-Bashir has pledged to honour their decision and celebrate together with the South. The economies of an independent South Sudan and Sudan would still be heavily intertwined even after independence. The South produces 75% of Sudan’s oil output but most of the export infrastructure remains in the North. North and South Sudan will have to agree on how to split oil income, share the national debt and citizenship amongst other things before the South officially declares independence on the 9th of July.
