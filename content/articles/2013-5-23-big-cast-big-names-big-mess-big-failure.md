What’s this? Katherine Heigl in yet another underwhelming romantic comedy? Amanda Seyfried as yet another googly-eyed bride-to-be? Robert de Niro in yet another brainless role? Diane Keaton as yet another neurotic old woman who is unlucky in love? Ben Barnes playing yet another charming but empty shell of a role? And is Robin Williams so out of work that he needs to resort to playing a priest for the second time? (Remember License to Wed? It’s best to forget aboutthat one) Such is the dire concept of this horrible mess of an ensemble comedy, a film that boasts having all these hugely talented stars, but one that doesn’t give any of the actors something interesting to work with.

It must have sounded great on paper (which could explain just how on earth this attracted so many stars). A remake of a French screwball comedy, dysfunctional family, a wedding that just will not go according to plan, siblings with issues with their parents, and two divorced adults having to act as though they love each other for the sake of avoiding embarrassment.

Don (De Niro) and Ellie (Keaton) must act as though they’re still married when their adopted Mexican son Alejandro (Barnes) is about to be wed to his love Missy (Seyfried); because Alejandro’s birth mother is a devout Catholic who doesn’t believe in divorces. Don’s lover Bebe (Sarandon) is not happy with this arrangement and is ready to cook up a little revenge for her man. Also invited to the wedding is the uptight sister of the groom Lyla (Heigl), and the 28-year-old virgin brother of the groom Jared (Grace).

It’s worrying how very few jokes actually stick, and there is absolutely nothing remotely touching about the various big long speeches that are made that are supposed to hint at nostalgia and a mature look at love.

Attempts to throw in moments of raunchiness by unwisely peppering the script with obscenities also fall flat, and it’s difficult to see just which demographic this film is aimed at.

“I’d rather gouge my eyes out with hot spoon” says De Niro at one point. Oh the irony...
