Have you ever felt that tension, that awareness that to achieve your goal you will have to fight and exceed your own limits? On the day of the most important match of the season the Imperial Eagles felt exactly that way.

The Eagles were about to play the second team of the English first division handball champion: Great Dane, the most titled team in the UK. Many of those first division players play also in the second division but to the Eagles this was not important. “Imperial! What is your profession? Augh Augh Augh!” Let the match begin!

The early stages of the game saw a solid Great Dane taking the lead on the Eagles who seemed shy in defense and attack. But on the 4-7, just when Great Dane was getting confident the Eagles struck back and scored 4 goals taking the 8-7 lead with mighty shots from left-back veteran Lucas Carlsten and right-back Max Flashback.

The Eagles were now in control and had their fate in their own hands (literally). The game proceeded with the Eagles leading by 1 or 2 goals until a yellow card to Lucas Carsten and a penalty offered Great Dane the equalizer. Perfect set-up for Great Dane right? You might think. Not when the goal-keeper is handball legend Stefan Bauer! Stefan Bauer, also known as Snakey B., saved the penalty and the Eagles maintained the lead. By half-time, line-player and club president Kolja Ortmann (Papa Bear as he likes to call himself) and left-back Yannick Seis had secured a 12-10 lead for the Eagles. “Hot jets of man-steam” from the Eagles!

As soon as the second half whistle echoed in cold Leyton hall, Great Dane began an aggressive defense policy. The Eagles offered a couple of counter attacks but maintained the lead. This time goals come from centre players Charles Magne and Kristof and a couple by the right wing signed Ruben Freytag. Left wing player and club captain Roberto Galli, elected more for his partying skills and outstanding physical beauty rather than handball talent, also scored a couple of important goals.

The Eagles’ Greek keeper Mega Alexandros, who is believed to descend directly from Alexander the Great himself, saved some tough shots and helped keeping the Eagles 2 or 3 goals up. At 5 minutes to the end of the game, with a five goal lead (23-18) the Eagles were about to make history and set a new standard for English Handball Second Division.

Despite all this, just when you think you can start heading for a warm shower and are already planning to grab some cheap celebratory lager from Tesco, that’s when you get punished (or bifflé as you say in French)! Complete madness and unmentionable handball from the Eagles allowed Great Dane to climb back to reach a final score of 25-25. Sacrebleu! What a shame! All in all, a draw is a good result and the Eagles proved capable of great handball… but this draw really does taste like defeat!
