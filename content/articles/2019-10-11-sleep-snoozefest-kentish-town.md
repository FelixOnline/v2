_1.5 stars_

Last Friday night: a dreary evening, where all I wanted as we headed off to Kentish Town was for my heart, body and soul to be warmed by heavy rock. Luckily, we were heading to the lovely O2 Forum Kentish Town, a theatre-turned-venue which tonight was hosting the 90s stoner rock legends Sleep. Unluckily, my heart and soul were not warmed by Sleep’s set (my body was though – 1.75 hours of two thousand people headbanging will warm any room up). Entering the massive, packed auditorium, Sleep were already on, and we tried to make up for lost time by fighting through the masses – not an easy job as Sleep fans don’t like to mosh but instead apparently like to stand completely still, allowing only their necks to swivel in a doom-induced trance. This hypnosis came mainly from bassist/singer Al Cisneros’ all-consuming, drawn out bass solos which felt like they took up half the set, whilst the other two members remained still waiting for him to finish. As far as the setlist went that fateful Friday, I simply don’t know when the band started a new song – they all seemed to be the same and there was no interaction between band and audience, something which isn’t necessary but could’ve really livened up an otherwise quite boring show. Perhaps, as a stoner rock band, their live shows need to be enjoyed as the band wrote them – high beyond sense. However, I was bored beyond sense, and having arrived late I then left early, something I have never done at a gig before. Typically Sleep then played their most famous song ‘Dragonaut’, but I was long gone. Sorry Sleep, but, well, you just sent me to sleep.
