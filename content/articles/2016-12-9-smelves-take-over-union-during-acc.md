The union was quite literally painted blue last week after another successful ACC. The makeover was a result of blue face and body paint runoff which was part of the costumes men’s rugby had selected for the occasion.

The rugby players, who attended as ‘Smelves’ (the hybrid of a smurf and an elf, which roughly translates into half naked blue men) left a trail of blue paint in several union spaces (and on several people) with one College source describing the mess left in the restrooms resembling “a battlefield only everyone was bleeding blue”.

The mess didn’t go unnoticed by Union officials. As Rachel Blythe, Deputy Finance and Services, told felix, “we are aware that several groups of students were dressed up for the ACC event last night [sic], some of whom were wearing face and body paint. After the night ended, there was paint left in the sinks and on some of the tiling in the East Wing male toilets.”

Following the night’s celebrations, men’s rugby offered to help clean up according to Blythe.

“The group of students responsible volunteered the following day to clean up the space without complaint. By the afternoon the toilets were clear.

Overall, the ACC night was very successful, the Union having taken steps to reduce door and bar queuing times.”

Perhaps the ACC night was a bit too successful though, as it saw a Union staff member floored after a collision with a drunk student.

“I’m not sure if it was on purpose or an accident. I protected my camera and phone but got up quite quickly while the drunk guy was still on the floor”

We approached Dan Green, Union Bar manager for comment.

“When they were leaving their shift, one member of staff noted that they were inadvertently knocked over earlier in the evening by a guest, but there was no indication that this was malicious or intended, so no further action was needed at that point.”
