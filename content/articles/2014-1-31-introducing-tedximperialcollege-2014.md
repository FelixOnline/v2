Following the success of the first TEDxImperialCollege conference held at Imperial College two years ago, and TEDMEDLive last March, students from Imperial can now look forward to yet another thought-provoking, mind-engaging TEDx conference to be held on 29 March.

TED conferences rose to fame globally by spreading innovative and inspirational ideas. TEDx events are organised independently but adhere to the TED format, and are licensed by the organisation in the spirit of their mission Ideas Worth Spreading.

This TEDxImperialCollege conference promises something more futuristic and forward looking than the first TEDxImperialCollege which was centred around the theme the Great Exhibition. With the bold theme ‘One Step Ahead’, you can expect this to be a conference filled with the great ideas of tomorrow. This conference promises to explore ideas that are breaking new ground and revolutionising the human experience.

TEDxImperialCollege 2014 will be moving back to campus after last year’s TEDMEDLive popped across the road to the Royal Geographic society to entertain and inspire 450 Imperial students and staff. This time, however, the event has been moved from the Great Hall, the venue of 2012′s runaway success, to the Business School. This means attendees will have to secure places more quickly than ever as the new venue is smaller and there will only be approximately one hundred tickets going on sale this time round.

Ticket details haven’t be announced just yet, but if previous years of TEDx and TEDMEDLive at Imperial are anything to go by, they’ll be some of the hottest tickets in town.

In the coming weeks, the full list of hand-picked speakers will be released and Felix will report on these announcements as they are made. You will find updates as well on the website and social media pages. A lot of excitement is building up as the countdown towards the next TEDxImperialCollege begins. And indeed, to become part of TEDxImperialCollege and all the exciting ideas that define our tomorrow, be sure to keep an eye on the TEDxImperialCollege website at __tedximperialcollege.co.uk__

TEDxImperialCollege is also on Facebook (__facebook.com/tedximperialcollege__) and you can follow TEDxImperialCollege on twitter _@TEDxIC_.
