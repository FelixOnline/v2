For the perfect pumpkin you will need a pumpkin (surprise surprise), a large spoon, a pencil, a and tea light, one small and one large knife, plus lots of newspaper. If you plan on carving multiple pumpkins it’s best to do it outside. If you’re cutting them inside, be sure to cover the table properly with newspaper.

Draw a circle of diameter about 5 inches (depending on the size of the pumpkin) on the top of the pumpkin. Cut this out using a large knife, ensuring that the knife is at a 45 degree angle to the surface of the pumpkin (otherwise the lid with fall into the pumpkin when you replace it).

Put the lid to one side and remove the seeds inside with a large spoon – the small knife may also be useful for this

Draw a face onto the pumpkin. If you want to keep to the traditional scary face, draw two triangular eyes, one triangular nose and a creepy jagged mouth.

Use the markings to cut around with the knife. Make sure you cut perpendicularly to the surface of the pumpkin.

You can create detail using the smaller knife.

Place a lit tea light inside the pumpkin and replace the lid. Enjoy your spooky pumpkin!
