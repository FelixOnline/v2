__The Dark Knight Rises: July 20__

Christopher Nolan is back with the third film in the series with Christian Bale reprising his lead role. After the massive success of _The Dark Knight_, we expect nothing less than awesomeness from this one. New evil rises (Tom Hardy’s Bane) and Anne Hathaway appears as Selina Kyle (a.k.a. Catwoman); definitely something to look forward to.

__Breaking Dawn - Part 2: November 16__

Many reasons to rejoice about this one. Twihards will be getting their closure, whereas critics who can’t stand Edward and Bella will no longer have to watch another Twilight film after this one. Although there are rumours circulating that Summit, the franchise’s production company, don’t want to stop at number five.

__The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey: December 14__

From the creators of _The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy_, we have the long-awaited prequel. The Hobbit (novel) portrays the adventures of Bilbo Baggins, before the happenings of the LOTR series. Given the fact that the series turned out to be one of the best trilogies the world has ever seen, high expectations ride on this.

__The Dictator: May 18__

2011 saw the deaths of many dictators: ranging from Gaddafi of Syria, Kim Jong-Il of North Korea to Osama Bin Laden. But Sacha Baron Cohen is more than confident that he will out-do all of these men. Expect to be utterly outraged and offended as the man responsible for Borat and Bruno will no doubt say and do some unthinkable things.

__Men in Black III: May 18__

After a 10-year break since the last film in the series, we have the third entry, MIB III. This one has time travelling involved with creepy aliens and loads of action. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones slip comfortably back into their roles, and there will be new faces too: Emma Thompson, Josh Brolin but most worryingly, PCD’s Nicole Scherzinger.

__Skyfall: October 26__

Bond, James Bond, is back. MI6 is under attack and Bond must eliminate the threat. Be prepared to be shaken and stirred. Under the direction of Academy Award winning Sam Mendes (_American Beauty_), Craig will no doubt be a competently moody British secret agent we have all come to adore, and Javier Bardem’s stint as the villain will be epic.

__The Avengers: April 27__

Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Captain America team up in an organization formed to save the world. It’s an ambitious film with a 220 million dollar budget. Will it manage to blow our minds all the while keeping a sane storyline or will it turn out to be a convoluted scrambled egg of superheroes? Only time will tell.

__The Bourne Legacy: August 17__

Based on the _Bourne_ series, and Robert Ludlum’s novel of the same name, _The Bourne Legacy_ brings us a new CIA operative and his experiences. Matt Damon is no longer with us on the franchise, but Jeremy Renner is just as talented and can make a likable hero, as evidenced by his outstanding turn in _The Hurt Locker_. Joan Allen returns as Pamela Landy.

__Django Unchained: December 26__

“A slave-turned-bounty hunter sets out to rescue his wife from a brutal plantation owner.” The hype surrounding ths is solely due to its director and ensemble cast. Quentin Tarantino, _(Inglorious Bastards, Pulp Fiction)_ is behind this film and he has teamed up with DiCaprio, Jamie Foxx, and Samuel L. Jackson. Great director + great cast = great movie?

__Brave: August 17__

Any Pixar film is well worth the wait, and their latest is setting out to be an exciting new adventure film with a strong, quick-witted female protagonist. As the beautifully animated poster may suggest, the computer graphics will be eye-poppingly surreal, the action scenes exhilarating, and the script sharp, full of humour aimed for both kids and adults.
