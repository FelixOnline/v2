_He wanted the world to know his struggle_

The Life of Pablo really wasn’t worth the hype (sorry Ben). And Mr. West certainly isn’t happy with all the critics who have dared to suggest it isn’t the god-like masterpiece he had hoped (Pitchfork gave it a 9.0 so I don’t know why he’s complaining). I guess life’s hard being married to a businesswoman who earned $52.5 million in 2015. Kanye needs some help, and he needs it now. His art might be great, but it’s not worth more than building schools for the impoverished.

_Kendrick Lamar steals the show, but Taylor Swift steals his Grammy_

To Pimp A Butterfly won five Grammy’s at this year’s ceremony, missing out on the main prize to T Swizzle’s 1989. Swift’s latest album was great and might have been deserving any other year, but it pales in comparison to Kendrick’s politically infused LP. #GrammysSoWhite

_Please no (Mackle)more_

On Monday, **Macklemore** released ‘Spoons’, which some critics have labelled “the worst song ever recorded.” My 13 year old cousin could have written a song with more mature themes: “And she’s like, Can you undo my bra strap? / I try to play it cool, in my head I’m like, Aw yeah!” How did this guy ever win a Grammy?
