Christmas has come early! (Kind of). Through the miraculous luxuries the 21st century has brought us, I've compiled the artists from last term's '_Totally Hot Album of the Week_' column into a Spotify playlist. It starts off with a bit of a toe-tapper from __Slow Club__, slides into the melancholy minimalism of __Youth Lagoon __and __Vondelpark__, strays into the hip-hop fuzz of __Main Attractionz__ and __A$AP Rocky__, ventures over to a near-perfect dubstep track by __Balam Acab__, before taking a short sojourn with __Blue Sky Black Death__ and __Real Estate__ and ending with a belter by __Girls__ that starts slow but finishes transcendentally. My only regret is that __Clams Casino__ isn't on Spotify and is therefore conspicuously absent. Hope you enjoy it!
