March 2011 saw Imperial College Finance Society hold their first ever conference at the highly impressive Bloomberg Headquarters. It was here that the New Financial Worlds Conference was born. With an attendance of over 200 individuals from a diverse range of backgrounds, universities and professions, it was a real opening success for the society. Now in its fourth iteration, the New Financial Conference 2013 will be held in the prestigious Barbican on the 30th November.
 The conference is unique in the sense that it is split into two streams - Global Markets and Investment Banking. Attendees choose their area of interest during the application process and if successful attend talks and activities tailored to that area of the financial world. The day commences with formal introductions over refreshments which will then be followed by our headline speaker, Benoit Savoret, who has a multitude of titles on his résumé including: EMEA COO of Lehman Brothers, Head of Global Equities at Nomura and EMEA CEO of Macquarie Group, just to name a few. IEach stream will have senior professionals discussing topics related to that field. Talks can range from anything concerning their particular field of work, their past experiences and achievements or interesting subjects relating to the industry. A few of the other speakers participating are:
 Achintya Mangla - Co-Head of Equity Capital Markets EMEA at J.P. Morgan, Arne Staal - Head of Index Products & Systematic Strategies Research Europe at Barclays
 Mark Howden – Head of Consumer Group at NomuraAlong with talks, each speaker will then participate in a panel discussion where delegates get the opportunity to see four brilliant minds give their views on various matters. Both Investment Banking and Global Markets have a tailored activity, an M&A competition and a trading game respectively which are judged by industry experts.
 As well as talks from the industry’s elite, there will be opportunities for
 attendees to ask their piercing questions during the networking sessions arranged and the mini careers fair on offer. Additionally, there will be a different activity for each stream of participants, creating an opportunity for attendees to showcase their real financial prowess. As such, this conference would be the perfect opportunity for any student to gain a deeper understanding of the industry no matter what their current level along with hands on experience through the activities.
