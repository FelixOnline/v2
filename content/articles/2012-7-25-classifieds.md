As I am leaving the country soon, I am selling a black and white HP LaserJet P2015d in perfect state, printing on both sides (duplex), fitted with a toner still 3/4 full. Selling price: only Â£59. Please contact me via email: [catherine.wu08@imperial.ac.uk](mailto:catherine.wu08@imperial.ac.uk?subject=Printer).
