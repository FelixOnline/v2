The [Etymotic](http://www.etymotic.com/) MC2 headset is an in-ear, noise isolating headphone and microphone combination promising high-quality sound. It also has a single button that can be used for tasks such as answering calls or pausing what’s playing. I’ve been using them for the last week, and I have to say I’m finding them pretty good. Of course, compared to a particular known-brand of white earphones (don’t ask – my old earphones broke), most headphones are going to be a decent improvement. However, I also have a separate pair of over-the-ear ‘phones, so they’ll be my point of reference instead.

Let’s first look at what you get for your £75. Etymotic supply four different pairs of eartips, so you can choose the style most suited to your ear. There’s also a custom ear-mould service available, but at another £75 I decided not to try it. You are additionally given a spare pair of filters, and a zipper pouch to store the headset in. While it’s no metal box, it gives more protection than nothing. The cable is meant to be reinforced with Kevlar too, which can’t be a bad thing for durability.

So how good are those supplied eartips at shutting out the distracting sounds of the outside world? It depends on what eartip you prefer. I use the foam ones, which are great. My experiences with the two sizes of three-flange variety show they perform well also. The ‘glider’ tips don’t stay in my ear however, so I can’t really comment – but I assume they’re not as great, as otherwise they’d fit better. My tips are comfortable too, with prolonged use causing no discomfort whatsoever.

Now for the important part – the sound quality. While not the most expensive headset/earphones on the market, you’d expect good results for your money with the MC2s. I’ve listened to a range of music genres as well as spoken voice, and I can safely say the earphones don’t disappoint. While they’re not the ‘bassiest’ headphones in the world, you can hear each note of bass, and the overall sound they deliver is full and rich. Those little nuances in the music that you don’t notice in cheaper headphones are audible, and you can hear all the parts of a given track. Overall, I’ve been impressed with the quality of audio that the earphones put out.

The microphone part of the headset worked well for a long telephone conversation I had while indoors, but apparently when outside there was a fair bit of ambient noise that made it difficult to hear me. Other than that though, the Etymotic MC2 is a good quality headset that delivers on the sound front.
