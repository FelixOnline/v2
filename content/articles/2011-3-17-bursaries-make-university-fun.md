Living the typical meagre student existence at Imperial College in South Kensington, one of the wealthiest boroughs in one of the world’s most expensive cities, was never going to be easy. But my soon–to–be alma mater (assuming I pass my damned degree) is going to make it a whole lot harder with the increase in tuition fees. The powers that be feel that Imperial is esteemed enough to demand £9,000 a year for a degree, and had this been the case when I was applying for university, I feel my parents would have been far less supportive of me coming here. After all, they have had to suffer most of the costs.

I am fortunate though. This year my parents have fallen on hard times and so I am a recipient of a [Study Support Bursary](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/registry/studentfinancialsupport/studysupportbursaries) (SSB). This bursary, with the addition of a maintenance loan and grant mean that I am quite comfortably staying afloat without being a burden to my parents. In fact, I have more disposable income than they do, and without the support of the bursary I would have already maxed out my overdraft, spent all my savings and be spiraling into debt. Admittedly part of this could be blamed on my penchant for clothes and cocktails, but I don’t want to give the impression that the bursary goes towards funding a life of luxury. My indulgences come from savings that any sensible person would conserve for the future. I hope my parents don’t read this.

But it is the absence of worries of mortgages, children and taxes that makes student life so enjoyable. This is why I think the bursary should continue to be given to students cash in hand. Sure, it would be nice to think that my future burden of debt could be slashed, but a more immediate necessity is having a roof over my head, affording food to eat and doing those recreational activities that make life at Imperial bearable. In all honesty, I’ve been almost unflinching about the rise in tuition fees. Part of this is down to a heavy case of Imperial student apathy, but it’s also because the future repercussions of tuition fee and maintenance loan debt feel completely imaginary.

Relieving accommodation costs would theoretically be the best way of ensuring that the bursary is spent the right way – akin to giving food vouchers to the homeless. But this is impractical after the first year when students move out of halls. It’s true that the bursaries can be abused, especially when you are surrounded by predominantly affluent students and an expensive location. The nearest Aldi is miles away and I still find South Kensington a culture shock, having come from a bland estate in Reading. I am continually bemused that there is so little disruption in the borough that council employees spend their time painting garden railings. Back home I’m more used to seeing charred bus shelters being repaired. Maybe I’m embellishing a little; it has only happened a few times.

In essence I’m saying vive le SSB, and may it continue to support the living costs of students in need. I know the system isn’t entirely fair, since I know students whose parents have a higher income than mine but do not provide as much as the combination of bursary and government contributions do. But then distribution of wealth has never been fair, and it’s important that those most in need receive help. Especially me.
