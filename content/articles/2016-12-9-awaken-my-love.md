Awaken, Gambino is back! Apart from doing his regular mixtape releases it has been a while since Childish Gambino has released an album to the public. It can be said that Gambino has evolved into a completely different artist since his 2013 debut of Because of the Internet, which was heavily rap based, with standard R&amp;B backbeats to the tracks. His 2014 EP release Kauai already hinted at a change in sound, which is heavily reinforced in his new album Awaken, My Love!.

This album relies less on the lyrics and more on the rhythm and the instrumental role. The sound, although new and fresh, reminds of 70s disco due to the heavy funk influence, especially Boogieman, where I can clearly hear sounds which remind me of Kool and the Gang’s Open Sesame. You can clearly tell that Gambino has taken inspiration from several artists throughout the creation of this album to achieve the complexity of sounds that he has. From rock and gospel influences in Me and your Mama to heavy synth sounds in Redbone, which sounds similar to something you would hear from Daft Punk, I believe Gambino takes you on a musical journey throughout this album.

Many of the track titles seem to be directed at Gambino’s son, with many referring to the boy’s mother and some directly to him. The lyrics of the track Baby Boy speak of the relationship Gambino hopes to have with his son as he sings, “Don’t take my baby boy”, which may be a fear of Gambino’s. The night me and your Mama met is purely instrumental which seems intentional to allow the listener to interpret the mood of the situation without the bias of spoken lyrics.

From acting roles to screenwriting to musical creator, Childish Gambino excels throughout, and this album is no different. Awaken, My Love! takes us through a whirlwind of funk exploration, which I gladly embarked upon.
