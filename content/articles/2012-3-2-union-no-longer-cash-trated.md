As many happy sober (or otherwise) students may have noticed, there is now a cash machine in the Union.

It has been placed in the alcove where the ousted cash machine used to be. The official Felix position is that the new cash machine “looks well like one of those ones in Fabric or McDonalds that charges you”. However, contrary to that, the machine is actually free of charge. In other words, it doesn’t cost you anything to take your money out.

Scott Heath, Union President, said on his [online Sabbatical blog](http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/blogs/2012/02/28/the-cash-machines-have-arrived/) about the news that it was “remarkably easy to find people who wished to install a machine that cost £1.50 or £3.00 per transaction” before going on to point out that finding a free-to-use one seemed “illusive”.

When the Union finally did manage to find a willing installer, BT said that the Union wasn’t in possession of a phone line that was suitably accessible. In addition, BT said that providing the correct line would cost £30,000. Luckily, for the Union, an alternative of using 3G was found.

[Heath’s blog post](http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/blogs/2012/02/28/the-cash-machines-have-arrived/) concluded by wishing prospective users “happy withdrawals”.
