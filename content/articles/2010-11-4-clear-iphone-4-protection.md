The iPhone 4 is a svelte piece of product design, with immaculate lines and a glossy, beautiful finish. Like it or loathe it, no one can deny that it is a gorgeous piece of hardware and, with it costing up to £600, you probably want to keep it that way.

In steps [Scosche](http://www.scosche.com/) with its take on the thin rubber iPhone 4 case. The glosSEE g4 comes in two colours, glossy black and colourless see-through plastic, but surprisingly you get both in one box.

The cases themselves are pretty plain, being made from one piece of a semi-flexible rubber that fits snugly around the outside of your iPhone. It offers your pocket-pal decent scratch protection for all but the screen, sadly there’s no included screen protector in the box, but its impact protection is fairly minimal. On the bright side the material the Scosche is made from isn’t of the super-grippy variety which means that getting your iPhone into and out of a pocket in the case is actually possible, but at the same time it’s not going to slip out of your hand.

The clear case allows you to see the industrial design of the iPhone 4 fairly well, with the only blemish being a relatively small Scosche logo on the back towards the bottom. Access to the camera, mute switch, dock connector and speakers are decent, whilst the volume buttons are covered but easily activated.

Overall the Scosche glosSEE g4 is an above average case that provides enough protection in the pocket and out on a table, but its thin and slippery enough to get in and out of pockets easily.
