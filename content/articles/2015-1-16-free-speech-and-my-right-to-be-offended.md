Whilst I’m writing this to help provide a Muslim perspective on the recent _Charlie Hedbo_ attacks, I do wonder how necessary that is. After all, is the Muslim perspective on the murder of over a dozen civilians really going to be different to the universal human perspective? Do you, Imperial College students, really need reassurance that your Muslim colleagues in no way condone such actions? Thankfully, I don’t think you do. When you think of ‘Islam’, your personal experiences and interactions with ‘normal Muslims’ at university can help you overcome the imagery of AK-47 laden, freedom-hating bigotry that Fox News or the Daily Mail would have others believe defines this religion. But not everybody has this counterbalance of personal experience to fight off the recent ignorance-fuelled hatred and fear. It’s only natural, therefore, that us UK-based Muslims feel a sense of apprehension when we see the media frame such incidents as a ‘clash of civilizations’ – the liberty loving West vs. the barbarism of Islam. One more step in what seems to be the inexorable path towards making Muslims ‘the other’.

Let’s not let that happen. Let’s make the effort to identify and communicate our overwhelming similarities to others whose only exposure to Muslims is through the fear-mongering cover pages of _The Sun_, and pave the way for a more harmonious future society.

As for the matter of ‘freedom of speech’ – this is a topic beyond the myopic snapshot of the current controversy. The decision on how far the legal right to offend others with your speech extends is not something I am interested in, as I would hope this wouldn’t act as the determining factor in most people’s behavior. (Am I legally entitled to make fun of you for being fat? Should I do so?)

That being said, if people for the sake of ‘comedic value’ choose to push these boundaries, the threat of physical harm should not be looming over them. If you are the resident of a country you implicitly agree to abide by its laws. If you find something distasteful, your response should be within the legal framework – Muslims of France, I’m sure, will have refrained from buying this magazine in a completely acceptable show of disdain prior to this mindless incident.

Whilst physical manifestations of displeasure are never justifiable, it is my unequivocal right as a Muslim to be offended by such lewd cartoon depictions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him, ‘PBUH’). ‘Lighten up, it’s just satire! They drew disrespectful pictures of the Pope, Jesus (PBUH) and the Virgin Mary as well and you didn’t see Christians getting upset!’ I, for one, certainly won’t be ‘lightening up’. Whether or not others are capable of laughing at their religious figures has no bearing on what my expected reaction should be.

Myself and other Muslims around the world may have a degree of reverence and respect for the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) that is difficult for those from the outside to understand, but it will not be changing. It’s worth noting here that within our faith Jesus (PBUH) and the Virgin Mary are also exalted figures, and so whilst many Christians may not take offense to their mockery, Muslims also find this extremely upsetting.

The point being – champion your right to offend by all means, but don’t try to impinge upon my right to feel offended. If you decide that you want to mock the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), then do so knowing that you will be upsetting myself and all other regular Muslims who you live and work with, and who have no animosity towards you. If you still choose to exercise your ‘freedom of speech’ in such manifestations, the only choice Muslims should consider is to respond within the legal framework, and never to resort to vigilante retribution.
