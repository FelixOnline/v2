My Week with Marilyn

Director Simon Curtis
Screenwriters Adrian Hodges, Colin Clark (novel)
Cast Michelle Williams, Eddie Redmayne, Kenneth Branagh, Judi Dench, Dominic Cooper, Emma Watson

Marilyn Monroe is without a doubt one of the most celebrated, well-known figures of the 20th Century. [_My Week with Marilyn_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJygETCXpR8), as its title may suggest, only explores a brief section of the icon’s life, but since she has accomplished so much, even the smallest slice in her showbiz-surrounded life is full of fun, romance and charm which is exactly what the film offers.

The Prince and the Showgirl, shot in England, (in)famously united Monroe (Michelle Williams) and Sir Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh), where the production was plagued with delays, miscommunication, and great discontent from Olivier, as he was far from impressed with Monroe’s notoriously erratic behaviour on set that included tardiness, alcoholism and drug use. Whilst My Week with Marilyn does focus on the filming aspect, caught in the middle of this is in fact Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne), the third assistant director, whose job is to do all the grunt work. Captivated by Monroe even before her arrival in London, Clark’s boyish enthusiasm and warm personality bring the two close together. Trapped in a less than satisfactory marriage to Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott), Monroe finds comfort and solace in Clark’s arms.

Milton Greene (Dominic Cooper), Marilyn’s business partner, warns Clark to not get involved: “She breaks hearts, she will break yours too.” But what they share has very little to do with sex or lust. It’s a strong friendship built on trust, with the occasional moments of passion that build up from spending so much time together. Although there is unavoidable tragedy lurking around the corner, director Simon Curtis makes sure the atmosphere is always light enough and the breezy script supports this. As the infatuated Colin, Redmayne is a wholly likable central character, with his wide-eyed, somewhat childish fascination towards everything that is going on around him. He is a tall, handsome actor with immense appeal, with enough cheek and confidence that he convincingly adds to his initially clueless character.

Success brings luxury, fame and infinite love from crowds, but for a price. The pressure she faces in Pinewood Studios starts to build up. Despite her acting coach Paula Strasberg’s (Zoë Wanamaker) supportive words, Marilyn finds her confidence shaken every time she stumbles on a line, further infuriating the already heated Olivier. Dame Sybil Thorndike (Judi Dench), is more understanding, and as a woman of principle and disciplined manner, she exudes warmth as well as firm maternal presence to anyone who unreasonably crosses the line.

No words can describe just how superb Williams is in the role of Monroe. She has the looks, the voice, the swagger, and the sassiness, but there is something so much more to her portrayal than what is visible on the surface. The behind-the-scenes Marilyn, the insecure, vulnerable and troubled superstar longing to be taken seriously, to be loved, and not quite ready to cope with all the uncomfortable sides the glitzy Hollywood life brings with it, Williams makes sure that Monroe is a human being after all, and that she is someone worth caring about. But she’s not all about the depressed Marilyn, as when her character gets her vibrant energy, she is delightfully glamorous.

As for the invaluable supporting players, Cooper’s wonky American accent aside, everyone stands strong in their roles, with two of the greatest English actors, Branagh and Dench, living up to their usual high standards. Wanamaker, as Marilyn’s coach who wants what is best for her most talented student, is stubborn and relentless, clashing with Olivier regarding Marilyn’s acting style. She believes in method acting, he doesn’t. Emma Watson, in her first post-Potter role, has an interesting role of Colin’s could-be girlfriend, and the two share a warm enough chemistry to show the audience a glimpse of possibility that Colin may be better off settling down for someone more to his standard. Although looking nothing like the wife of Laurence Olivier, Julia Ormond does an admirable job as Vivien Leigh, in a crucial scene that she hints at her jealousy towards the much younger, sought-after Marilyn.

It’s a light trek that gives us plenty of insight into the complicated life of Marilyn Monroe. We will never know the full extent of just how frightened she was of failing those around her, and just how lonely and isolated she must have felt. The film tries to show as many variations as possible, which can lead to quite a few repetitions. Marilyn is troubled, she calls for Colin’s help, he comes, calms her down, and she feels better. It’s a routine that is both predictable and slightly tiresome after a while, but it’s a film to watch simply for the flawless performances. Nominations should be flooding in towards the end of this year for Williams, and rightly so.
