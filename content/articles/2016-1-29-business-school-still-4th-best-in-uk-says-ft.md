Imperial College Business School’s full-time MBA program is the 35th best in the world and the fourth best in the UK according to the 2016 _Financial Times_ MBA rankings released this week.

The list, which is published annually, ranks business schools based on the average weighted salary of students, employment after three months, salary increase (the increase in alumnus salary from before the MBA to now), and a number of other factors.

The latest weighted average salary, which makes adjustments based on variations between sectors, of Imperial College Business School graduates after three years was     £78,400, an increase of around £2600 from last year.

The business school is considered at “the forefront of MBA teaching for a digital era” according to the Financial Times, referencing the recent £20 million funding for the KPMG Centre for Advanced Business Analytics. The KPMG Data Observatory, a 313 degree visualisation tool which launched in November, forms part of this investment.

Dr. Gawer, Associate Professor in Strategy and Innovation at the business school said, on the importance of digital business, that: “The fusion of business and technology is at the heart of where the economy is going. I think our MBA participants understand that.”
