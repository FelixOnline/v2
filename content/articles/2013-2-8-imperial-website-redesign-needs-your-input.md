The College has embarked on the [Website Redesign Project 2013](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/webredesign) and has requested volunteers to aid them in renewing the Imperial website for the first time since 2007. Events and consultations will take place over the next weeks in an attempt to gain insight into the views of student users.

According to the Rector’s staff briefing on the subject, the project will be led by Imperial’s Communications and Development and ICT department. [Domain7](http://domain7.com/), a web design agency, have also been hired to support the project.

The refurbishment is meant to update the website in order to meet the changing needs of the website. The College is keen to say that the current website is still “considered a sector example of best practice”, but they aim at changing the suiting the site at what they see as a potentially different audience structure and to refresh the design with included mobile compatibility.

The Domain7 agency will be organising multiple focus groups and interviews with different areas in the key audience, with users and other stakeholders on 14 February at 12-1:30pm. They are, therefore, still looking for some volunteers from prospective students, current students and alumni. Participation in this may involve testing and feedback to optimise navigation and user-friendliness. To find out more about taking part you can contact [e.chesterman@imperial.ac.uk](mailto:e.chesterman@imperial.ac.uk).

This will be complemented with a web forum on the 13th February covering development and design aspirations. This event can be attended by staff only by registering with Liz Smith: [e.swift@imperial.ac.uk](mailto:e.swift@imperial.ac.uk).
