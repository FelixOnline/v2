UPDATE 24/02/16 : FELIX has now learnt the bungee jump has been green-lit by college, although a new date is yet to be set.

RAG’s annual bungee jump has been cancelled just three days beforehand over health and safety concerns.

The RAG committee were contacted by senior college officials on Friday, who told them the bungee jump, that was due to start today, would not be happening.

The jump was rescheduled two weeks ago due to unsuitable weather conditions, and there were no concerns voiced by college over the safety of the event then. The latest cancellation had nothing to do with weather, with sources citing issues with health and safety.

RAG had changed bungee supplier since last year, but only to one deemed more financially stable by the union.

The RAG committee informed college of this decision last year and all the relevant risk assessments had been sent to college Estates before Christmas. The plan was then okayed by college officials, as it is every year.

FELIX understands that the President of Imperial College may have then raised concerns about the jump, despite having been here for last year’s event.

The bungee jump is a staple in the RAG week calendar, with students having jumped from a crane over Queen’s Lawn for several years now.

This year, students paid £40 for the jump, and each had to raise the same amount in sponsorship to take part. It is unclear whether the jump will be rescheduled.

It’s not been an easy year for RAG, with their magazine effectively banned this month, that story reaching national newspapers and their jailbreak team being hauled off a flight after terrorism suspicions.
