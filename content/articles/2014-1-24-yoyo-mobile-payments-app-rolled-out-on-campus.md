A new app, Yoyo, for mobile payment has recently launched at Imperial. JustYoyo is a business that was launched in August 2013, it is backed by Imperial Innovations. The new app enables food and drink to be bought from shops across the South Kensington campus.

Additionally, the Yoyo app can be used with loyalty programmes, therefore negating the need to carry multiple reward cards. This enables a simple and quick service to be provided to customers.

Later this term, Yoyo will also be available to use at the Union (fivesixeight &the Union Bar) and h-bar as well as all tasteImperial food outlets around college.

The company are also promising 10% extra on all top-ups in January and there are hints of rewards to come.
