Imperial College London have come fourth in the 2014 Complete University Guide league table. This is the same spot that Imperial occupied last year. Cambridge (pictured) came top, with Oxford second and LSE third.

In the subject tables, Imperial was also near the top; every subject was at very least in the top 10. There were five subjects that were second in their respective tables (Aero, Chem. Eng, Computing, EEE, Mech Eng), two subjects in third (Biology and Civil Engineering), three subjects in fourth (General Engineering â€“ a course not offered at Imperial but it could have been an amalgamation of subjects, Materials, Physics), and finally two subjects that came sixth (Chemistry and Medicine).

It was compiled by using nine metrics, which were similar to what other league tables use. These included student satisfaction, research, entry standards,staff to student ratios, spending on academic services, spending on facilities, good honours degrees, graduate prospects, completion data, and how green the university is.

Imperial was second for Graduate Prospects, with LSE at the top spot. Although for green issues, on the other hand, Imperial were much further down the table: Imperial were close to the bottom in this parameter.
