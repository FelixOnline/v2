     This design is steller! You obviously know how to keep a reader amused. Between your wit and your videos, I was almost moved to start my own blog (well, almost...HaHa!) Fantastic job. I really enjoyed what you had to say, and more than that, how you presented it. Too cool! <br>snapbacks cheap http://www.twofangtu.cn/snapback-hats,The information means electrical. Buy those cards of the fact that prices would increase promote those cards of the fact that price would drop. It's where the net profit comes hailing from. Once you often play fifa ultimate team on Xbox, you would get just a little advantage. There are a small difference while it feels like that business of PS3 is all the first one reacting. <br>credits fut rapidement http://creditsfut.com/

_Warriors_ is an important and, at times, genuinely moving documentary. It tells the story of the Maasai warriors of Nairobi, how their culture promotes FGM, and its ties into the AIDS epidemic. In a society where the elders are believed to have a link to God, it’s hard for the youth to be heard. The solution to this? Form a cricket team. It sounds odd, and one does spend most of the film wondering how this club is actually doing anything to help, but we do eventually get an idea, if a little too late.

Firstly, the game gives the community links to the West: the team works with the British army to build their pitch, and they travel to Lords to take part in an amateur competition. All this gives the men a different perspective on their often dogmatic culture, and it is this that spurs them to call for an end to FGM.

Secondly – despite a fiercely patriarchal society – the club allows men and women to play together as equals. Much of the film is spent following the team as they train for, and eventually partake in, their competition.

The question, however, is: how does this quirky tale of a cricket team fit in with the dark themes tackled? The answer: it doesn’t really. The film suffers from an awkward dichotomy in its tones, reminiscent of when a news anchor has to swap from a serious story to a feel-good one – awkward smile and all. _Warriors_ would perhaps have worked better if it either focussed on the team and – more importantly – its members, or as a _Horizons_-style programme focusing on the problem of FGM with cricket as a brief side point.
