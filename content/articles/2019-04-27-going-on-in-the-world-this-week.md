Brazil – This week Brazil’s government announced that it will no longer be hosting the UN global summit on climate change next year citing costs. The conference could cost Brazil up to $100 million. Brazil spent $4.6 billion on the 2015 Olympic games and it is expected that $33 trillion worth of damage worldwide will result from climate change by 2050 according to a 2016 report. Brazil’s prime minister, Mr. Bolsonaro, has called manmade climate change a plot by “Marxists” to stifle economic growth.
