 - hmmm The test will be Australias attack against the england batting line up If cook and co can contribute to Bells runs england will win easily But if not Then australia have a shout albeit only if Clarke is in his usual imperious form and barring any miracles from the England bowlers who have shown time and time again they have the ability to save games that the fragile batsmen have often looked like giving away Advantage EnglandCant wait for the Ashes to start The 30 scoreline from the summer does not tell the full story and I definitely agree that Australia look more threatening now Hoping for a close and exciting series with England winning of courseGreat preview especially the player by player breakdown of each team Im looking forward to seeing how this pans out

If there is one thing that almost seems certain, it is that England face a much tougher task than the one they undertook during the summer. With the addition of George Bailey (who showed strong form in the recent one-day series in India), Australia’s batting looks a bit stronger. England’s bowling hasn’t impressed as much as they would have liked in the tour matches, and the England management don’t seem too sure which bowling combination is their strongest.

However, England would have been very strongly encouraged by their top-order’s batting performance. Michael Carberry has shown that he is the ideal partner to Alistair Cook, which would also allow Joe Root to remain in the lower order where he has had more success.

Mitchell Johnson has been added to the bowling attack for Australia and has been looking dangerous – especially during the one-day series against India. James Faulkner, the Australian all-rounder, will also be expected to play in the test after showing his explosive credentials against India. In the five games against India Faulkner scored 65 and 116 – both at strike rates of higher than 150.
> England should have more than enough firepower to take the series comfortably.
However, despite this, his bowling was below par, and he will be looking to correct that in this series. The key to Australia’s challenge will be Michael Clarke and Ryan Harris, both of whom are injury prone. The Australian backroom staff will have to work overtime to make sure both last the series.

Writing the day before the Brisbane test begins, it is clear that whilst England will be tested more than they were this summer, they should have more than enough firepower to take the series comfortably. Pessimists, however, will point out that, whilst England won 3-0, they were probably saved in two tests by a combination of rain and contentious decisions. If those decisions had gone Australia’s way, the series may have ended differently. They have to be wary of that this time round.
