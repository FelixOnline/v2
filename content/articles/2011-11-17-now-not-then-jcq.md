This week I’m going back straight back to the UK post-punk/hardcore scene by way of a review of the debut full-length album of __The James Cleaver Quintet__ (JCQ), _That Was Then, This Is Now._ Nearly two years ago the JCQ released their first and only EP _Ten Stages of a Make Up_ to massive critical acclaim. Fans have been eagerly awaiting another release and on Halloween this year, they were given what they wanted.

If you read my review of __&U&I__’s album _Light Bearer_ two weeks ago then you will know that I like my music one way and one way only: mental. _That Was Then, This Is Now_ fits perfectly into this category. The album opens with a track titled ‘Golfing Pros, Bitches and Hoes’. This track starts off with an eerie tune, reminiscent of something you would hear at a fairground, but after only 15 seconds, shit gets real.

Their sound is completely unique, if I could describe it in any way it would be a divine combination of garage post-punk and hardcore. Punkcore? Garage post-hunk? No, that’s too weird. Sounds like a lost member of the Village People. But listen to the album and you’ll know what I mean.

The songs are fast-paced, with massive riffs and breakdowns. In terms of the singing involved, there is certainly an element of signature hardcore roaring but a lot of the vocals are melodic and extremely catchy. Every song has a chorus that I can guarantee will be stuck in your head at some point, which is uncommon for a post-punk/hardcore album and definitely a breath of fresh air. Vocalist Jack Saunders has a distinctive style, with an almost pop-punk sound in the less wild sections of the songs.

The tracks themselves are diverse, some of them being heavily post-punk without much of a hardcore element, and some of them being utter skull-crushing noise (in a good way). A couple of the tracks also have a definite blues feel with one of them, titled ‘The JCWho?’ being a full on jazz number until a hardcore breakdown mid-song.

If you have been to one of their shows, you will know of their unmistakably punk attitude, indicated by the fact that by the end of each show there is always some blood coming from somewhere (usually the bassist’s face). This definitely comes across on the album and from start to finish you feel like you’re in the presence of this amazing band.

Ten Stages of a Make-Up was an incredible EP and I wasn’t sure if they would be able to top it but they have had a bloody good go. They currently have a free download (available on their Facebook page) of an awesome track from the album if you’re interested. If you’re reading this in a lecture then I have only one thing to say to you: f\*\*k lectures, go and listen to this album!
