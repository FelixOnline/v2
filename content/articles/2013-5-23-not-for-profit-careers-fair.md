Imperial College London is hosting a careers fair that is just for the Not For Profit sector on Thursday 13 June. It is a new event that has been added after feedback from Imperial students. Companies in attendance will range from the Civil Service Fast Stream to Teach First to Global Vision International.
 Students from all years will be able to take part in the event, which, like all other careers fairs, will involve students meeting employers at their stands. There has been one other Not For Profit event this academic year, which was a Not For Profit Forum last November. This was more of a conference than a traditional careers fair.

In the past there was criticism over the way that careers fairs were run.
