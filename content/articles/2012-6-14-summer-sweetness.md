     it was very hard and she was tired all the time and dizzy. She also lost all her body fat and all her muscle and had to have a long rest afdatwerrs.Squeeze half a lemon or one whole lemon in a glass of water every morning and evening to clean out your system. And drink lots of water to flush your system. That will help clear up buttons and acne and stuff. Nothing else is necessary.,Hi,I've seen that in some blogs the name of the user is a link for a site. How do you do that?? Do you put the href code in the name field of the comment form or it has to be done <a href="http://heabjkemmd.com">anortehway</a>.I also try the on a blog and it showed the html code instead of the anchor text. Can you explain why in some blogs it work and on other blogs it doesn't??Thanks,

Modified recipe from the book _Vegan Pie in the Sky by Isa Chandra Moskowitz_.

Ingredients

_For the base_
 1 and ¾ cups graham crackers or digestives
 3 tablespoons sugar
 4 tablespoons melted non-hydrogenated margarine
 1 tablespoon milk

_For the cream_
 6 ounces silken tofu
 Salt
 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
 ½ teaspoon lemon juice
 1 cup soy milk
 ½ teaspoon agar powder
 ½ cup sugar
 1 tablespoon cornstarch
 1 teaspoon lemon extract
 Juice of half a lemon or lime

Procedure
 Preheat the oven at 180°C. Oil a 9-inch pie dish. Crush the biscuits and add the sugar and melted margarine and milk. Press the biscuit mixture in a 9-inch pie plate and bake for 8 minutes. Let it cool and remove it from the pie plate. To make the cream filling, combine the tofu, salt, vanilla extract, lemon extract and lemon juice in a blender. In a small saucepan, combine ½ of the milk and the agar powder, cook for 5 minutes stirring occasionally. Add the sugar, milk and cornstarch in a cup and whisk. Add this to the simmering soy milk mixture and stir for about 5 minutes. Add the cooked cream in the blender with the tofu and the other ingredients and blend until very smooth. Pour it immediately into the baked pie shell. Refrigerate for at least three hours.
