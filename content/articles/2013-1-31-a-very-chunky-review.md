It definitely sounds as if it’s going to be amazing. The fudge is actually pretty nice. The problem is when you compare it to just a normal Chunky: doesn’t add so much that you think it’s revolutionary. Okay, we know that it’s not exactly supposed to be pioneering new grounds, but, still, some innovation please.

Big expectations were in store for this one. We basically assumed it was going to be a Kit Kat Chunky with a massive strip of Bounty-esque coconut in the middle of it. Turns out we had false hopes and it was just chocolate that tasted faintly of coconut. Weak taste meant it just tasted odd.

This was the one that sounded amazing. In our minds, it was basically a Kit Kat Chunky Peanut Butter but with Nutella instead. That sounded incredible. It did actually have a strip of hazelnut stuff in it, and was pretty good, Still not close to the PB one, but it has mileage and could be the real deal.

Reminscent of the classic Club chocolate bar or some people’s (Tim only probably) childhoods. It’s actually just a Kit Kat Chunky with mint chocolate covering it instead of the normal chocolate you get. Can be touch and go. Tastes okay, but there’s certainly no GIVE ME MORE factor.
