For the 3rd consecutive year, the Israeli Society organised a seven day trip to Israel last March. The trip aimed to show the growing tech sector of Israel, as well as the cultural side of the country. Want to be a part of it next year? Why don’t you take a look at what two participants this year remember from their first time in the Holy Land.

_Mohammed Sakir Mahmood, Medecine:_

“Israel is rich with history and controversy. Mainstream media today focuses on the political conflict within the region. However, what the Israeli Society has achieved is moving the spotlight away from politics towards something that is undeniably Israeli to its core: the start-up nation. Many students at Imperial College have been involved in the entrepreneurial world, or at the very least, have heard the term thrown around in discussion; but experiencing a nation which has built its current standing on innovation was truly something else. 

Human capital is a key resource in the country, and a mindset of challenging the status quo is commonplace. The combination of the discipline instilled by compulsory military service, and the country’s focus on STEM education, has produced innovations such as Mobileye and Pillcam. It was truly a privilege to visit establishments such as the Technion, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Weizmann Institute — the birthplace of many of these world-changing technologies.

As well as the wide-ranging tech visits, the programme included many opportunities to explore the country’s rich culture and natural beauty. A highlight of the trip was climbing Masada to watch the sunrise amongst the beautiful vistas surrounding the mountain; the significance of the place was made apparent by the history lesson we received from our tour guide, Ilan Bloch. The story of King Herod’s retreat and the Jewish settlers was simply fascinating. Israeli food is also something to behold, from the deliciously sweet and creamy Malabi to the rich and savoury Shakshuka — needless to say our appetites were whetted well.

Last, but not least, the religious significance of Israel wasn’t lost to us. The Bahai gardens in Haifa was a spectacle to behold indeed, with lush trees lining the walkways adorned with gleaming white marble, all in the presence of tomb of the BahaUllah. Jerusalem, being a religious epicentre for Jews, Muslims and Christians, showed us how these groups live together. 

The committee of the Israeli Society should be lauded for their efforts, as the trip was a truly monumental achievement that they should be proud of. Their efforts led to students from all departments and many different walks of life coming together and creating memories to be cherished as well as lifelong friendships. It was a privilege to be part of this trip, and I recommend anyone reading this, to apply for next year’s Israel tech trip!

Shalom.”

“As everybody else went home for Easter, a diverse group of students from different walks of life set out on an eye-opening trip to the Holy Land.

Our goal was to learn about the fantastic technological achievements of the start-up nation, while exploring the rich natural beauty the land had to offer. Each of us had preconceptions of Israel, and we set out to see what the country could offer. 

What we got was a glimpse into an ancient culture, a story of a people whose resilience was embodied, not only by their famous entrepreneurial spirit but also by an unending struggle to find their place in the world. This story was told by the spectacular sights and sounds we immersed ourselves in, from the blood fraught history of Masada, to the harrowing narrative of the Holocaust Museum and the bustling nightlife of Jerusalem and Tel-Aviv. Adding to the narrative was open-ended and thought-provoking discussions with the locals, students from Israeli universities and our various guides, foremost of them Ilan.

We started the trip in Tel Aviv, riding the local Lime rented bikes while savouring the delicacies of Carmel Market. Historical heritage and technological innovation were intertwined in all aspects of the city. Being Imperial students, we were able to appreciate the country’s strong emphasis on technological advancement, best exemplified by institutions including the famed Technion, Weizmann Institute and Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Some of the astonishing displays included a world’s first nano-sized Bible and models of Nobel Prize winning quasi-crystals.

Yet with all that modernity, we were also exposed to another side of Israel – the more alluring side. We stayed in a Bedouin camp in the Negev with (God forbid!) no cellular service, enjoying traditional Arab dinner and basking in the starry night. 

In Jerusalem, we learned about the rich religious heritage of the Muslim, Christian and Jewish peoples, distinct yet inseparable in a modern city with a historical core. It was the most enriching experience of the trip, in terms of historical context and cultural understanding. The nightlife of Jerusalem brought another dimension to the city. In contrast to many European cities, the Israeli markets were still well lit and raucous, even at 10pm.

Spending a week in Israel felt long. When it was time to finally say our goodbyes, we did so with vows to return.  The enriching experiences invoked a sense of awe and perspective that will remain in our memories for years to come. Someday I will reflect on my life, and I’ll remember this one week when we visited breathtaking places, enjoyed great food and had unforgettable experiences with absolutely amazing company.”
