The unfit, untrained and turkey stuffed IC girls rocked up to Ethos on Monday night with much foreboding, the unmistakable sense of apprehension and anxiety could only mean one thing. Medics. This year’s match was made even more personal due to Becky’s unfortunate living arrangements with the medic captain.

The team’s strategy was simple, win and win well. IC got off to a great start over turning the first Medic centre and scoring the first two goals. In the meantime, captain Lucie was eager to sever any prior medic relations ensuring the opposition captain crumbled to floor in her wake. However, from here things started to go a bit pear shaped and our lack of training became evident towards the end of the first quarter with IC narrowly leading 8 – 6 when the whistle blew.

Things picked up in the second quarter and there was excellent movement in the IC goal third between shooters Angela and Heather, however the medics had some good set plays in the centre third and IC were unable to extend their lead, the score at the end of the first half was 15 – 13.

After a rousing team talk at half time the IC girls returned to the court feeling revitalised, it was a fantastic quarter and there was brilliant defensive play from Fern and Nakai, intercepting many balls in the medic’s goal third. The IC girls finally looked like they were on form, there were some exceptional shots from goal shooter Lucinda and great passing around the goal third by centre Sarah and wing attack Lucie. IC were able to score twice as many goals as the medics, increasing the lead at the end of the third quarter to 25 – 18.

In the last quarter the medics rallied together for a final attack but it wasn’t enough to worry the IC girls and the final score was 32 – 24.

Despite some untidy play it was a good first game back for the third team and a promising start to the term.
