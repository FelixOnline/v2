In recent weeks two of Imperial College London’s biggest sports teams have been embroiled in various activities that have brought Imperial College Union into disrepute. The sanctions against the teams are causing innocent students to miss out on playing sport. Is this treating everyone fairly or have the disciplinarians allowed themselves to get influenced by the media?

Regarding the sanctions affecting ICURFC; it was the 1st team that committed the offence not the entire club, yet the whole club is facing punishment from the actions of a few. The Union statement: “We regret that some individuals who may not have been involved in these incidents will suffer as a result of the punishments” they then go on to talk about how “culture and behaviour of the clubs as a whole needs to change.”

Having been a member of a sports team here at Imperial for the last five years, I think it is important that the Union recognises the difference between a club culture and a team culture. Whilst all the teams are part of the same club the bond between team mates is completely different and maybe it is the team culture that needs to be dealt with.

I was Club Captain of Netball last year and I think the motion of no confidence against Tom Hobson is hugely unfair; it has made the issue personal. Club officers are all volunteers; while nominally you are in charge in reality you are trying to manage the actions of your peers. This is not an easy task. Whether Tom’s actions were ‘correct’ or not in the eyes of the Governance Committee he was looking out for his club and his members’ best interests.

Whilst stripping down and drinking on the tube is illegal and disruptive the safety of those involved and the public was not compromised, whilst a smashed window on a coach could have had dangerous consequences. I would infer that damaging the reputation of the College is seen as a more serious offence than putting yourself and others at risk.

I think the actions of both clubs needs to be punished but I question whether the best decision has been made and whether the severity really matches up with the crime.​
