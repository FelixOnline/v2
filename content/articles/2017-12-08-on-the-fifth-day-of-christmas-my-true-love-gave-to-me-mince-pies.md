Every country in the world seems to have its Christmas food. Here, they are Christmas cake and mince pies – which disappointed me at first. A lot. But, hey, British food can grow on you. Eventually. 

**Squashed peach and almond mince pies**

This was the first mince pie I’ve tried and I was a bit like “Where is the mince?” Since then I’ve learnt what mince pies are and I must admit that these peach and almond ones are my favourite. They are soft with some crunchy bits, and sweet enough to satisfy my need for sugar. 

**Apple and satsuma mince pies** 

These are the softest mince pies I’ve tried because the apples are normally grated. I think that apples and orange are normally a very good mix and they just scream ‘Christmas is here’. Besides, there are some versions that contain rum, too. 

**Cherry, mincemeat and liqueur mince pies**

The cherry and the liqueur add a luxurious side to the mince and, for the brave one, they can also be mixed with a cocoa batter. This is definitely something special and dark – not an everyday mince pie but something to really enjoy.

**Lottie Shaw’s seriously good mince pies**

These are sort of a mystery, if you ask me! They claim to be the “authentic taste of Christmas” and, weirdly, I feel like they are – even if I have no idea what authentic mince pies taste like. They are mouth-watering and the pastry is delicious. Even if I cannot say for sure what they are filled with, I can definitely confirm that they are very nice with a glass of red wine. 

**Traditional mince pies – actually contain meat!** 

These are probably the last ones I’ve tried and I think they are fairly difficult to find, with all these sweet mince pies that are around. They are interesting, to say at least, but they are definitely not a dessert. Still, I can see them as a nice starter on most Christmas tables.
