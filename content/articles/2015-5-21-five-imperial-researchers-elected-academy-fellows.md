Five researchers from Imperial College London have been elected to the Fellowship of the Academy of Medical Sciences in recognition of their work in medical science.

Professors Wendy Atkin, Christl Donnelly, Jorge Ferrer, Michael Way and Martin Wilkins will join 39 other new Fellows to be formally admitted in a ceremony this July 2015.

Academy Fellows are recognised for excellence in medical research, and in particular for their innovative application of scientific knowledge, or service to healthcare that is perceived as significant.

Professor Wendy Atkin specialises in Gastrointestinal Epidemiology in the Department of Surgery and Cancer. Her research was key to the development of a new national bowel screening programme.

Christl Donnelly is Professor of Statistical Epidemiology in the MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling, part of the School of Public Health. Her research is crucial to the study of disease outbreak.

Professor Jorge Ferrer, Head of the Department of Medicineâ€™s Epigenomics and Disease Section and Leader of the NIHR Imperial BRC Genetics and Genomics Theme, has made contributions to pancreas regeneration and diabetes research.

Michael Way is a Senior Scientist at the Francis Crick Institute and Professor of Virology in the Department of Medicine. His work has developed our understanding of how viruses use the cytoskeleton within our cells to spread through the body.

Finally, Head of the Department of Medicine Martin R. Wilkins, a Professor of Clinical Pharmacology, was elected for his research examining new disease treatments through proof-of-concept studies in humans.
