10. 20 Feet From Stardom

An incredibly insightful documentary that looks at the lives of incredibly talented singers who provide the backing vocals.

9. The Babadook

Australian actress Essie Davis provides a stunning performance in this year’s most intelligent, emotionally charged horror film.

8. August: Osage County

It is an acting masterclass packed full of juicy performances, larger-than-life characters, and the most memorable dinner scene you’ll see this year.

7. Two Days, One Night

Marion Cotillard is mesmerising in the Dardenne Brothers’ effortlessly touching, socially relevant piece that powerfully resonates.

6. Dallas Buyers Club

The McConaissance went well under way with Matthew McConaughey deservedly winning his Best Actor Oscar in this moving AIDS drama.

5. Nightcrawler

Jake Gyllenhaal is a charming sociopath who wishes to make it to the very top. It’s a fascinating thriller as well as a character study.

4. The Wolf of Wall Street

Leonardo DiCaprio is on top form as usual in Martin Scorsese’s highly energetic, completely uninhibited look at Wall Street corruption.

3. The Imitation Game

The true story of British hero Alan Turing has been wonderfully translated for the big screen with Cumberbatch perfecting the role.

2. 12 Years a Slave

A very worthy Best Picture winner earlier this year at the Oscars, Steve McQueen’s unflinching look at American slavery is unforgettable.

1. Boyhood

Richard Linklater has managed the impossible: filming over 12 years and flawlessly putting everything together, he has made a true classic.
