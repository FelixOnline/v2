__10. 20 Feet From Stardom__

An incredibly insightful documentary that looks at the lives of incredibly talented singers who provide the backing vocals.

__9. The Babadook__

Australian actress Essie Davis provides a stunning performance in this year’s most intelligent, emotionally charged horror film.

__8. August: Osage County__

It is an acting masterclass packed full of juicy performances, larger-than-life characters, and the most memorable dinner scene you’ll see this year.

__7. Two Days, One Night__

Marion Cotillard is mesmerising in the Dardenne Brothers’ effortlessly touching, socially relevant piece that powerfully resonates.

__6. Dallas Buyers Club__

The McConaissance went well under way with Matthew McConaughey deservedly winning his Best Actor Oscar in this moving AIDS drama.

__5. Nightcrawler__

Jake Gyllenhaal is a charming sociopath who wishes to make it to the very top. It’s a fascinating thriller as well as a character study.

__4. The Wolf of Wall Street__

Leonardo DiCaprio is on top form as usual in Martin Scorsese’s highly energetic, completely uninhibited look at Wall Street corruption.

__3. The Imitation Game__

The true story of British hero Alan Turing has been wonderfully translated for the big screen with Cumberbatch perfecting the role.

__2. 12 Years a Slave__

A very worthy Best Picture winner earlier this year at the Oscars, Steve McQueen’s unflinching look at American slavery is unforgettable.

__1. Boyhood__

Richard Linklater has managed the impossible: filming over 12 years and flawlessly putting everything together, he has made a true classic.
