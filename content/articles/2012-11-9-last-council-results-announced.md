Joseph Gibbs was elected in Round 1, with the other two being elected in Round 2. The faced competition from four other students, as well as the ever present, infamous RON (Re-Open Nominations).

The even catchier titled Faculty of Medicine Postgraduate Council Ordinary Member Electioon was won by Maia Kavanagh Williamson with 7 votes. The other candidate gaining 1 vote. Therefore Williamson was elected. This singles the end of Council election fever.
