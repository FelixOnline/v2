You might have noticed there’s been a bit of controversy about the Oscars. _The LEGO Movie_ got completely snubbed for Best Animated Feature, and a lot of people got very angry, very, very quickly. The directors (Phil Lord and Chris Miller) responded in their typically wonderful style, with the former posting a picture of an Oscar statuette made of LEGO, and the latter issuing heart-felt thanks to all involved in the film, as well as noting that “everything [was] not awesome.”

But with the obvious outrage over an animated snub aside (even though it’s true, _The LEGO Movie_ has been pre-emptively robbed), there’s been a more pressing and glaring issue, in the complete overlooking of _Selma_ – or, for that matter, any actor or actress of colour. _Selma_’s Best Picture and Best Song nominations feel like a token gesture – a vague gesture in the direction of a film that has won near-universal acclaim. Morten Tyldum – the director of _The Imitation Game_, a film that was good because of its strong lead performance, not its weak direction – was nominated over Ava DuVernay, who produced something truly incredible in _Selma_.

Elsewhere, there were some genuinely valid nominations – Michael Keaton’s turn in _Birdman_ is almost a dead cert, and rightly so, while Wes Anderson finally gets a nomination for his directing work for _The Grand Budapest Hotel_, his finest film to date. Rosamund Pike’s performance in _Gone Girl_ finally got her the recognition she deserves, while seeing J.K. Simmons nominated for his appearance in _Whiplash_ just feels right.

_Guardians of the Galaxy _sneaks in with two nominations – Visual Effects and Make-Up & Hair, while the film that it was hoped would finally mark British director Christopher Nolan’s embrace by the Academy falls a little short, with_ Interstellar_ only making appearances in the technical categories, albeit deservedly so.

It’s a mixed bag of nominations, all in all. There are some very, very right calls, and there are obvious front-runners for the awards. But there also some worrying omissions, with the fact that the Academy is predominantly old, male and white being more obvious than it has in years.

### Felix Film’s Guide to Oscar betting

As the awards season builds up to its maximum climax that is the Oscars, it becomes increasingly easier to predict the winner. And so here are some of the predictions in the popoular categories. Bet at your own risk.

Best Picture: As shown in the poster above, the clear frontrunner here is _Boyhood_, a film of remarkable achievements that was made over the period of twelve years. The only real competitor this faces is _Birdman_, but given how _Boy_ has triumphed over _Bird_ in pretty much all the important awards thus far, the top prize of the night is likely to go in favour of what has been dubbed _12 Years a Boy_, taken after last year’s winning picture, _12 Years a Slave_.

Best Actor in a Leading Role: Michael Keaton, in his fantastic return to form in _Birdman_ is bound to take home his first ever Oscar of his career. He does face stiff competition from audience-favourite Eddie Redmayne of _The Theory of Everything_, but the Brit actor is far too young to be winning in this category.

Best Actress in a Leading Role: Julianne Moore, believe it or not, has never won an Oscar. She has been nominated a bunch of times and has sure been snubbed over the years. 2015 will be her year, in her heart-breakingly real portrait of an early-onset Alzheimer’s patient, in _Still Alice_.

Best Actor in a Supporting Role: J. K. Simmons, who has long been working as a character actor appearing in bit parts, finally has the chance to shine as a ruthless, terrorising conductor of a jazz band. His supporting performance in _Whiplash_ is winning all sorts of accolades, and rightfully so.

Best Actress in a Supporting Role: Patricia Arquette’s beautifully nuanced performance, spanning a period of over a decade, is a part of what makes this ambitious tale of _Boyhood_ work so well. With a Golden Globe already in the bag, an Oscar is looking very much a likely scenario for this underrated actress.

### And the Golden Globe goes to...
