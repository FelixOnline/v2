[IC Radio](http://www.icradio.com/), one of the oldest and coolest student stations in the country, is the official sound of Imperial College London. Broadcasting and streaming in crystal quality from icradio.com, we are on air 24 hours a day, alternating between live shows and playlists from our huge music library.

Anything and everything goes on air there’s [Best Foot Forward](http://www.icradio.com/shows/609/), your weekly dose of the best new music and underground artists while [The Happy Hour](http://www.icradio.com/shows/683/), hosted by happy Michael, is an hour of random fun and LOLz! accompanied by the latest pop/chart tunes. [Mad Craic](http://www.icradio.com/shows/637/) is an award winning, highly entertaining blend of banter and music from the astonishingly Irish Aislinn Hayes and the wonderfully English Craig Woods while over on [Matt Colvin’s The Sound of Success](http://www.icradio.com/shows/724/) the worlds of game shows and radio

chaotically collide as two contestants battle it out over 58 minutes to hear their song of choice. On [The Eclectic Ectoplasm!](http://www.icradio.com/shows/729/) Eamonn plays a bit of everything and anything with a co-presenter adding their weird and wonderful music taste into the mix every other week. Then there’s the [Anime Hour](http://www.icradio.com/shows/728), making your life sound as epic as anime, one song at a time and the[ National Student Radio Chart Show](http://www.icradio.com/shows/623), a chart show hosted each week by a different student station and networked across the UK. [The AMS Night Bus](http://www.icradio.com/shows/722/) sees the return of the Alternative Music Society to IC Radio while [Modcast](http://www.icradio.com/shows/711) features British Mod, Ska and Northern Soul of past and present. [Prime Cuts](http://www.icradio.com/shows/646) offers up your weekly serving of grime, hip-hop and any deep dark tunes in between, then there’s the wildly eclectic [Outhouse](http://www.icradio.com/shows/698): pretentious music, verbose conversation and a fine choice in anecdotes, all related to ATP. What more could you want? If you’re a fan of rock in all of its forms, tune in for music and chat with Tom and Matt on [Rock and Roll Ain’t Noise Pollution](http://www.icradio.com/shows/688). Then for admirers of modern electronic and bass music there’s [Touch Bass](http://www.icradio.com/shows/713) and [Bass Case](http://www.icradio.com/shows/686) to name just a couple and [Through the Looking Glass](http://www.icradio.com/shows/714/) is a chat show hosted by Giulia, a lover of strong (VERY STRONG) opinions, inappropriate behaviour and ridiculous outfits.
