Two men in their mid-20s were taken to hospital after a stabbing near Notting Hill Gate station in the early hours of Monday morning. They are both said to be in stable condition, but the first was described as serious and the second as critical.

Officers received a call from the London Ambulance Service to Kensington Mall at around 03:30, where they found one man suffering from knife wounds. They also found a second man with similar stab injuries metres away in Royston Court, on the other side of Kensington Church Street.

Kensington Church Street was closed between Bedford Gardens and Notting Hill Gate for several hours to facilitate police investigations, causing severe delays in the area as buses had to be diverted down narrow streets. No arrests have been made so far, but police are currently appealing for eyewitness information on suspicious behaviour in the Kensington Church Street/Notting Hill Gate area.
