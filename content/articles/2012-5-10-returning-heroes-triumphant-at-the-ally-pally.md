This was my first time at the epic venue which is Alexandra Palace and I was not disappointed. With support from __Rae Morris__ and __Lianne la Havves__, the evening had a solid start but it was the first few songs of __Bombay Bicycle Club__’s set that really kicked the show into gear.

The set was largely composed of songs from the most recent album and the bands’ debut, with classics such as ‘[Open House](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kqchrZEv6w)’ and ‘[Dust on the Ground](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPgetSbJ8II)’ mixing well with more recent hits like ‘[How Can You Swallow So Much Sleep?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgvBmEmtF-I&ob=av2e)’. Only two songs were played from their acoustic folk tinged second album Flaws, which I thought was a shame but they ended up being the highlight of the night for me.

I found that the moments where beautiful songstress __Lucy Rose__ provided backing vocals, especially on ‘Still’ which was perfomed stripped down with only a piano for accompaniment. It was a fragile, heart-breaking moment which was shared by, what seemed to be, the whole of London packed inside the Palace, hushed in reverence.

The song which the whole audience was waiting for, ‘[Shuffle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7l-4xjc4ps)’, was played triumphantly during the brief encore. Everyone seized on this song to sway, jump and bounce around to the baggy drums and funky bass riff in a moment of sheer joy.

This show only validated my opinion that Bombay Bicycle Club are ready for bigger stages, even if they themselves told me that they are very unambitious. I heard rumours circulating that they could headline Reading and Leeds next year, and at first I could not picture it, but after that accomplished performance, such feats seem inevitable to me.
