Everyone is familiar with the perceived positive and negative connotations of Marijuana. In 2016 alone, 51% of Americans smoked cannabis, and its global use is on the rise due to recent legalisation in several US states. However, despite its widespread use, surprisingly little has been confirmed in terms of its effects on the human body.

So far, its legal status has hindered rigorous scientific testing of cannabis, and studies performed so far have left more questions than answers. It is thought it could have significant medical potential. Unfortunately, any potential medical benefits are yet to reach the public sphere.
A new study published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine in Washington D.C., has collated all available negative and positive impacts of the drug. However, the main point of the study is that the legal status of cannabis needs to be changed, so that researchers can access it easily. If it is going to be treated as a medical drug, then it should be tested as one. Without more testing, claims of cannabis being a ‘miracle cure’ are relatively unfounded.

From over 10,000 studies, several negative and positive effects of the drug were found. Use of weed can lead to other drug addictions, alcohol abuse, and increased chance of developing psychological problems such as schizophrenia. Such issues can arise with long-term and regular use of the drug. There is very low support in terms of its effectiveness as a treatment for epilepsy, and cancer, despite claims. Encouragingly, researchers confirmed that it does not increase the risk of lung, head and neck cancers. However, the influence of the drug on heart issues and other cancers has not been researched.

Positive effects include reduction of chronic pain, and multiple sclerosis patients have reported increased muscle spasms on taking the drug. The smoke may deter inflammation-related infection, but data on immune responses is lacking. Few or no findings support its effectiveness in treating PTSD or Tourettes syndrome.  This is not to say that cannabis is conclusively bad. While in some cases the negative links are clear, long-term studies are needed to test other health impacts. For example, the impact of cannabis on memory and attention span is known, but there is little data to support that use influences unemployment or school drop-out rate. Moreover, the clear health benefits, such as reduced nausea in cancer patients, highlight the need to test it further.

It is clear that marijuana has great potential. Currently in the UK, medical use of cannabis in the form of Sativex, containing two chemicals from cannabis, can be prescribed to MS patients. Cannabis itself for medical use is still illegal, and anyone using it for medical reasons can still be charged for possession.  Several MPs have called for its legal status to be reassessed.
