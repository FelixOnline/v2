A student manifesto has been released in light of the London mayoral and assembly elections in May. The document, produced by [Student Vision for London](http://visionforlondon.org.uk/) in collaboration with many London universities’ student unions, outlines nine key issues for students with demands for the mayoral candidates to solve them.
 London’s student population stands at 433,000 - roughly one tenth of the city’s voting population. Vision for London believe that students are currently under-represented by the Greater London Authority and their issues are poorly accounted for.

Working with Imperial College Union, as well as student unions from the University of the Arts, London School of Economics, King’s College and Queen Mary, Vision for London have identified nine problems, and solutions for them, which affect a majority of students.

The issues fall into the categories of crime, transport, housing and employment, and include demands for a 30% discount on pay-as-you-go travel, a higher maintenance allowance to reflect the greater cost of living in London, and an investigation into the poor state of student housing, with a view to creating a student charter for landlords.

The needs of international students are also considered, with calls against discrimination and restrictions on who can be a guarantor for international students’ accommodation. One issue raised by the Imperial College Union was to oppose the strict and often confusing regulations on student visas, claiming that they are detrimental to London’s economy and competitiveness as an academic centre. They also were keen to promote problems which do not just affect Imperial students.

A potential mayoral candidate debate happening at Imperial College is being planned, with union president Scott Heath believing we are best-positioned to attract Boris Johnson to speak; however, so far there are no confirmed details on this.

The Student Vision for London organisation urge all students to register to vote at their term-time address. Their manifesto, and more information, can be found at [__http://visionforlondon.org.uk/__](http://visionforlondon.org.uk/).
