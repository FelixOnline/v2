If you’ve ever carried a MacBook Pro out and about with you, you’ll know that a laptop bag is essential. Considering you’re carrying around the best part of £1000 at least, when it comes to a bag you’re going to want something well built and with decent padding, God-forbid you drop the thing. Be.ez thinks it has the answer with the LE rush, a range of Apple laptop bags that combine lightweight materials with silicon padding.

Available in three colours, the LE rush features a main central compartment for your laptop, with a padded band along the bottom and up the edges of the bag, which provides impact protection to the edges of the laptop. There are also two slip pockets and a Velcro closeable document wallet in the main compartment for ancillary stuff.

The front of the bag features a Velcro-sealable, expandable pocket for things like a power adapter. Inside that there’s also a slim line zippered pocket with two slip pockets for smaller items. On the back of the bag there are also three slim line slip pockets, useful for bits of paper you need quick access to.

Overall the LE rush features light but hardwearing materials, a solid construction and decent protection for your beloved laptop. Complete with a nylon shoulder strap and bespoke sizes for the 13 and 15-inch MacBook Pros, as well as a smaller ‘netbook’ bag, the LE rush line deserves to be in your sights if you’re looking for a slim but sturdy bag. Yours for around £30 from all good retailers.
