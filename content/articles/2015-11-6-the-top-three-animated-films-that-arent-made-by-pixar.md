 - These are very cool I usually have a sense that Star Wars mbieraomlia is a bit  done The same evocation as 40yearolds wearing skater jeans or businessmen riding micro scooters but this is something different I think its fitting with the sarcastic nature of modern pop culture I can see this sitting more appropriately above a fireplace among tankards and rifles than in amongst action figures and DVDsThumbs up

I love Pixar. Chances are you love Pixar. too. In all honesty, I’d hazard a guess that the vast majority of sane people on earth love them. Their films are iconic and have set the precedent for animated films that both children, adolescents and their parents can enjoy. But instead of watching Finding Nemo for the eleventh time, why not give some other storytellers a chance to wow you?

#### Song of the Sea (2014)

Released first in Ireland and England only earlier this year, Song of the Sea describes the epic adventure of Ben and his younger sister Saoirse, whose newly-found magical gift means that she must first find her voice in order to save the spirit world. Brimming with luscious visuals, mature storytelling, and Celtic charm, this film is quite possibly my favourite of the year.

#### Kiki’s Delivery Service (1989)

Often described as a ‘Japanese Walt Disney’ – a title he hates – Hayao Miyazaki (for obsessives such as me) is a man against which no other animator can compare (yes, he’s better than John Lassiter or Chuck Jones). Kiki’s Delivery Service stands alongside Ponyo and My Neighbour Totoro as one of Miyazaki’s more child-friendly contributions, perfectly telling a coming-of-age tale about the life and times of Kiki, a young witch who must adapt to a new life in the city.

#### Help! I’m a Fish (2000)

Okay, hear me out guys. Yes, it’s a terrible title; yes, its subtitle is ‘a potion put them in the ocean’; yes, it has a 5.8 on iMDB. Just know that it’s not me who’s wrong – it’s everyone else. This film tells the story of a group of friends with only 48 hours to find an antidote to the potion which turned them all into fish. It is is genuinely funny, wonderfully Don Bluth-esque, and even features Alan Rickman singing a weird pop ballad – what’s not to like?
