Last week, Felix reported on a con man operating near campus, who was asking people to help him retrieve his car.

This week, another student has informed Felix of situation that is not too dissimilar. It has come to light that around London Fashion Week, two men, described roughly as “southern European” approached a student while they were driving in their car. The incident occurred just outside College, on Queen’s Gate, next to where the Bulgarian Embassy is situated.

The student was walking home from College when the two men approached and engaged the student in conversation. The men said that they were very poor and that they wanted to sell some designer clothing for very cheap prices to quickly obtain money. The student immediately attempted to dial 999. At this point the two men drove up to the student and started shouting abuse.

The student managed to get a photo of the two men (pixelated, above), and sent it in to Felix.
 The two men followed the student down Prince Consort Road, hurling abuse in an intimidating manner.

The car that the two men were driving was described as a blue Sedan. The number plate of the car was given to Campus Security and the Campus Police Officer.

The student in question advised anyone else to: not try to interact with them, and under no circumstances try to get in their car or be anywhere near an enclosed space. I was luck enough to avoid anything more serious happening to me, but this may not always be true.
