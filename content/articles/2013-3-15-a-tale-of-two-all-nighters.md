Along time ago, in a Union room far, far away an intrepid young fresher decided to attend her first all-nighter. Young and innocent, this girl did not know what to expect and this is the magical, mystifying tale of what she found there...

Well maybe magical and mystifying aren’t quite the right words, when you consider that the long time ago happened to be Christmas, and that the Union Concert Hall in Beit really isn’t that far away. But I digress. I shall set the scene. A young, fresh faced girl considers her options for the last week of term. She suspects that it may well be spent in an alcohol induced haze, as the nights out and nights in when you’ve drunk too much to get out continue. But instead she finds herself in a room thick with the smell of popcorn and hot dogs as she prepares to watch the first of many exciting films she has been waiting to see. The rose tinted memories of this night are filled with the happy joyous laughter of those running on caffeine and sugar as they enjoy the incredible, emotional moments of Madagascar 3. Or the fear that filled the room at six in the morning as the sleep deprived enjoyed the delights of Cabin in the Woods. But her memories are also filled with the camaraderie of those participating in the event. The half joking, half intensely fierce competition over the prime seating, those desirable marked out with layers of blankets and pillows as the owners queue up for food. The quizzical look shared by all with the realisation that the Sainsbury’s basic chicken and mushroom pot noodles are vegetarian, but the chicken ones alone are not. And her personal favourite, the three in the morning ‘who can drink the most sugary tea’ competition with a complete stranger, whilst engaging in a conversation on the comparisons between the film and the novel of Perks a Being a Wallflower. And does she regret this decision, despite having lectures the next day? Not in the slightest.

But this is a new term with a new all-nighter. This has been a good term for the cinema, with three films doing particularity well. First we showed the romantic comedy Silver Linings Playbook. I’m sure it was noticeable in many ways, one being that it was a romantic comedy that didn’t make me want to run away and hide at the over repeated clichés, but it also featured Jennifer Lawrence. And it is hard not to love a girl who fell over on the steps whilst trying to collect her Oscar for this film. Next it was Argo. The film that, through careful manipulation of the facts made America look great and everyone else look a bit rubbish. But even knowing that, I was amazed by how much Ben Affleck made me care for characters that I thought were initially unlikable, to the point that I felt relief when the ending that I knew was coming from the start of the film finally arrived. The last film was showed that had the audience running in their droves was Life of Pi. In case you haven’t read the book/ seen the trailer or even the poster, this film asks the question. ‘What would happen if a boy was trapped on a lifeboat with a tiger?’ With stunning visuals and a great score (hello Mr Oscar for both), this film was perhaps my personal favourite of the three. Now you may have noticed, oh observant reader, that these films have something in common. Each one was nominated for the best picture Oscar, and in the case of Argo, even won it.
TODO: image from 
So we took the common denominator of ‘People like Oscar best picture nominees’ and we stuck not one, not even two, but four into the set list for the Spring All-Nighter. Lincoln, Django Unchained, Les Miserable and Zero Dark Thirty. After Lincoln, that Americany, presidenty Spielbergy film you will probably feel like an expert on American history. So what better way to test your new found knowledge with the history exam that is Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter?

Django Unchained alone is worth watching: filled with Tarantino’s signature wit and chaotic bravado as seen in the likes of Pulp Fiction, coupled with darker insinuations about racism in America, the film also features stunning performances from German dentist turned bounty hunter Dr King. Schultz aka Christoph Waltz in an Oscar winning role and Leonardo DiCaprio in an out of character turn as a nefarious slave owner. Despite what you make of his recent efforts, Django is a definite return to form.  
 We’ve also got Les Mis. This is the only film I am aware of with a trailer that has made someone cry, which probably says something about how sad it is. And that’s just the trailer. Bring your wellies guys, the floor will be sopping from the tears of grown men moved to cry by Anne Hathaway’s raw and unintentionally hot performance. We’re charging £1 a hankie. For the tears, you understand.  
 We’re also screening Zero Dark Thirty directed by Kathryn Bigelow-the film cashing in on the hunt to catch Osama Bin Laden. Based on insider files that may or not have been dubiously authorised by the US government, the film follows the hunt to find Bin Laden through the eyes of a front-line CIA official as it gradually consumes her life. The conclusion which let’s face it, doesn’t take a genius to figure out, somehow manages to be nerve-bitingly tense and gripping. Just ignore the mildly insufferable America Fuck Yeah! message and you can enjoy how Bigelow’s crafted an intense, thrill-ride of a movie.

The last film is famous for the number of Oscars it won. Best Vampire, Most Historically Accurate, Best Overacting, Silliest Fight Scene and Best Axe Swinging at a Tree to mention but a few. Wait, you don’t remember these awards? Maybe it was all a dream after all. I did think meeting Jennifer Lawrence was too good to be true.

So there it is. A chance to see five films for the price you would usually pay to see one. And a decent excuse to miss lectures the next day. So what are you waiting for, book your tickets now. I’ll see you there!
