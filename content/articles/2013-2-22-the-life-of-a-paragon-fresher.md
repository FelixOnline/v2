Paragon, described on the University web-site as: “a high-quality, award-winning, purpose-built hall of residence with excellent transport links and good shopping and leisure facilities available”, has been a source of quite some controversy amongst Imperial students. Sounds idyllic, so what’s the problem?

[Primarily it’s the distance](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/3355/paragon-a-case-study-of-distance/). With the closest tube station located in zone 4 of the Piccadilly line, the 40 minute commute to university is gruelling, especially for a 9am start. After a 10 min bus journey there follows the challenge of pushing one’s way onto a central bound train. Usually there are no free seats, so we stand. Even so, it is not uncommon for it to be so crowded that we are forced to wait for the next train. Paragon is situated so far out that the underground runs above ground. Now that is saying something; so much for “excellent transport links”.

Secondly it’s the location of the actual Hall of Residence. Situated in Northfields, Brentford, I find it misleading to promulgate the shopping and leisure facilities in this area. When I look out of my flat window, I have an excellent view of the GlaxoSmithKlein headquarters as well as the M4. Maybe I’m being unfairly critical; it does have its perks. Besides from tall buildings and cars there is also a Petrol station, a Co-op and a local Fullers pub!

Finally Paragon is impractical and overpriced. Due to its location there is no way of oscillating between Halls and South Kensington during the day. This means two things: packed lunches and long days. Once you’ve left Paragon, you’re committedto staying on campus.

This leaves you with the choice of either become a hyper-efficient expert in time management and organisation; or quite the opposite. Many decide to not go in for lectures in the first place. After all, they are recorded, sparing you a 1 ½ hour commute that day.

With summer exams coming up and the university work load building up the “Paragon Paradox” is becoming ever more transparent to us. It is safe to say that I write this on behalf of all Paragon Residents, who are all equally frustrated with their living conditions and the blatant unfairness of our situation. The incontrovertible truth: Brentford, Middlesex is not South Kensington, London.

Hopefully this article will call into question the plans to develop a [new undergraduate hall of residence, W3, in North Acton](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/3347/anger-over-new-halls/). Please not another Paragon!
