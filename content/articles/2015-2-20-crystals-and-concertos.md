It was the end of one of the last weeks of term; uni life was definitely hectic by that point, or at least it was for me. It was lab week, so although I was knackered from a long week of afternoons at the bench, Friday was exciting and rewarding. I had finally completed the third experiment of the term and obtained large, defined crystals. This seemed to bode well for the concert later that night, or perhaps it placed me in a better mood in advance of the performance. Going straight from labs to pre-concert rehearsal was quite a transition, but also a lovely way to celebrate the end of the week by doing something that I love, besides Chemistry!

The concert itself was an even bigger adjustment. Playing in the Sibelius Hall, Helsinki, last summer was an experience that I’ll never forget. Performing in the Great Hall, right in the heart of a university so focussed on science where we are used to academic work, was also a unique experience. It was even more exhilarating as the concert was completely sold out!

This undoubtedly lifted everyone’s spirits and boosted the jubilance of our opening piece – Dvorak’s Carnaval Overture, which received wonderful applause. The adrenaline continued on into my performance of Prokofiev’s Second Violin concerto, and I hope everyone enjoyed it as much as I did. The first half of the concert was very well-received with rounds of applause, and the second half was no exception. After Marquez’s festive Danzon and Rachmaninov’s atmospheric and much more solemn Isle of the Dead, we received a standing ovation! All who attended the concert that evening thoroughly enjoyed themselves and we would like to thank those of you who came to watch us perform!

After a restful break (apart from revision for some), ICSO is gearing up for our next concert; Saturday 28th February, 7.30pm at Cadogan Hall, near Sloane Square. The programme includes a varied repertoire and features Martin James Bartlett, BBC Young Musician of the Year 2014. It is definitely a concert not to be missed!

The programme opens with Gershwin’s An American in Paris, full of jazz and saxophones. This is followed by Mozart Piano Concerto No.20, with Martin James Bartlett, which is a total contrast to the first piece and a chance to witness the virtuosity of the pianist. The second half has a Russian theme with Borodin’s In the Steppes of Central Asia and Stravinksy’s Firebird Suite; music from a mystic ballet of love and oppression.

I am looking forward to returning into the orchestra to accompany our soloist and I can’t wait to perform such a great programme!

_Tickets can be purchased online, or in person on 25th and 26th February, at the Blyth Centre on 5th floor of the Sherfield Building, as well as on the door._
