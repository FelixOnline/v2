Council Chairman Baroness Eliza Manningham-Buller concluded [her statement to the All Party Parliamentary Group](http://felixonline.co.uk/?article=1829) on Thursday 17 November calling on Government to hold a “proper, and preferably non-political conversation, on [the issue of drugs], to review current policies and explore whether there are others offering better hope of success.” Nevertheless, amongst the various reasoned and well measured responses to the suggestions, last week’s speech has perhaps predictably generated opposition solely focusing on the cannabis angle, leading to claims of “spongy liberalism” in [one particular publication](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2063186/Spooks-seen-heard--subject-drugs.html?ito=feeds-newsxml). Such suggestions could not be further from the truth.

A review into our current drugs policy is, at the very least, long awaited. Indeed, the effects that drugs have had on the criminal industry for the past several decades show no immediate signs of abating. Eliza remarked in her speech on the wide range of “misery” that drugs perpetrate. That is not to say (as some publications appear to have implied) that it was suggested that the immediate legalisation of cannabis would suddenly solve the problem at hand. Rather, Eliza said that a considered “non-political” conversation would certainly be a first step towards a full and frank review. Such a review would be a bold move by the government that has already taken bold moves with regards to the budget and other aspects of policy.

Obviously, with the ongoing concessions that can only accompany a Coalition Government, such an objective may appear to be increasingly far off, especially with the government’s current stance on drugs. Political machinations play no part in an issue so interconnected with areas as wide as crime and health. A review conducted by the country’s most informed scientific minds, outside of the country’s current political climate would, at least, avoid snap decisions in terms of legalisation. One can only hope that the government recognises the growing list of scientific figures calling for such a debate.

Felix applauds Eliza’s decision to add her voice to this list. Our Chairman’s message has generated much needed debate across the country on an issue that certainly needs a rethink, not least following the surge of popularity in ‘legal highs’ over the last few years. After all, surely it is better to have a full understanding of the potential dangers of drugs, rather than taking even greater risks?
