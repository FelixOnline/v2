 - Surprisingly weak line up too much of this electro house crap The Cocoon and Pyrda stages have enough talent though and i suppose the Annie Mac one I think its better to go a mixed genre music festival

[Creamfields](http://www.creamfields.com/) UK is a two day dance festival held by the Cream clubbing brand from Liverpool. It is held on the August bank holiday weekend in England just outside of Liverpool and hosts a large number of DJs from a variety of different genres. The festival has really evolved – from its beginning as a small one day event in the year 2000 – to a global sensation bringing together the world’s best DJs. In previous years artists such as The Prodigy and Tiesto have appeared in the line-up. However, live acts, such as Friendly Fires and Gnarls Barkley also play at this festival. This allows for a relaxing atmosphere if you feel like you need a break from the rave. Tickets vary from £135 for a three day camping ticket to £60 to just go on the Sunday. There are also VIP tickets for those that enjoy being close to the action but do not enjoy the grime involved with camping. This gives access to hot showers, posh toilets and the Hed Kandi Hospitality Arena along with free parking. There are 10 stages across the whole festival meaning that there is a plethora of choice when it comes to deciding what to listen to.

The line-up this year is incredible and makes for an epic show on the 11th birthday of the festival. It is an amazing display of modern dance music with drum and bass DJs such as Danny Byrd, Andy C and the Scratch Perverts to electro/house DJs such as Tiesto, David Guetta, Calvin Harris and Fake Blood. This is just a taster of the acts available to see. There are also a number of UK/Dance festival exclusives: The Chemical Brothers, Armin van Buuren, Swedish House Mafia and Paul van Dyk. There would be no other opportunity to see this many great DJs all for such a decent price. This is certainly a clubber’s paradise. There is no doubt that if you love dance music then this is the festival for you; Creamfields UK has gone out of their way to find the DJs at the frontier of their genres meaning that this will honestly be a collection of the most outstanding DJs around the world. This festival will not disappoint.
