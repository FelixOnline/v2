Step into the Troubadour and you don’t know where to look first. On one wall is a stained glass window and rows of antique coffee pots; on the other, a vintage electric guitar. This perfect blend of the rustic and retro arrests the senses, and something tells you you’re in for a treat.

With its buzzing atmosphere and quirky personality, warm and friendly staff, the Troubadour is a perfect place for a first date or an alternative night out with friends. Traditional English food is served in great volume to small, intimate tables, and quality is certainly not compromised for a reasonable price tag; meals start from £8, with steaks nearing £20, but why not treat yourself? Between us we sampled the fish and chips and the popular Troubadour burger, noting the refreshing lack of grease, attention to detail and general perfection. The fish and chips may have been £13, but wow, that is what you call fish and chips! It is worth noting that all ingredients are sourced locally and with great care, the secret to the dishes’ perfection. If these are not for you though, you could always try one of their omelettes or salads. And most importantly, such hearty portions still allowed room for dessert! The apple crumble was flawless and the brownie literally melts in your mouth.

Adding to the eclectic feel of the Troubadour is the basement nightclub. Rich in history it has hosted the likes of Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix, and, more recently, Paulo Nutini. Every week a selection of exciting performers who write and perform their own material, treat audiences to a novel experience. Particularly pertinent to student tastes, the nightclub serves 2-4-1 cocktails, available from 8-9pm.

The garden is yet another asset to the Troubadour’s charm. Under a grape vine canopy, this hideaway provides a tranquil environment right in the busy centre of Earl’s Court, a short tube journey from South Kensington. The adjacent Troubadour wine shop is also worth a stop. The shelves are stocked with unusual wines from around the world with prices to challenge supermarket prices.

From 9am onwards the Troubadour starts its day as one of the Top 50 places to eat breakfast in London, so why not check out the full English? Failing that, stop in for a coffee during the day and watch the world go by. Our advice? Don’t miss out on the buzz that is synonymous with this wonderfully time-warped, bohemian gem.
