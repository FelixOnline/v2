Unless you live in a cave, it is quite hard to overlook the fact that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is finally out. First of all, it is difficult to walk down an entire street without seeing at least one poster, and secondly because the film has immediately become a source of wild disputes. Surprisingly, it’s not a conflict between Potterheads passionately defending the film and the others condemning it – from my experience, it is often quite the opposite. What is the reason behind this and how well did Fantastic Beasts actually do?

My first impression after leaving the theatre was that the film was very wrongly advertised as another Harry Potter story. It is easy to see why the fans of the original series might be disappointed – it is absolutely not. You will come across references to Hogwarts and its characters from time to time, but apart from those, expect a story which takes place in the same world with the same rules, but explores a completely different aspect of it. Fantastic Beasts is not a children’s tale anymore, it is an adult one. So, a piece of advice: drop your expectations of Harry Potter 8 – there is the Cursed Child for that – and try to accept it as a new era of J.K. Rowling’s magical universe.

Based on the trailer, I was a bit sceptical whether the plot would be strong enough to hold your attention for over two hours. After all, it’s “only” a hunt for magical animals, isn’t it? Luckily, I was more than pleasantly surprised by a presence of another, rather unexpected, storyline which gives the film a good balance of light-hearted and dark moments. Moreover, there are many brief but important scenes which reveal that there is a lot going on under the surface. Of course, I won’t spoil it but let’s say that it justifies the need for four more parts. Well, at least it does for me!

The beasts are one of the highlights of the film. Some are cute (like Niffler!), others hilarious and yet others, awe-inspiring. It is very satisfying to see they are not there for the sake of CGI show-offs but each have a unique personality and you’ll surely find one you’ll love (Niffler!). Speaking of effects, one has to admit some of them might be just for eye candy, but Fantastic Beasts doesn’t rely on digital tricks as its main driving force. And, to be honest, who doesn’t want to have their breath taken away by a majestic Thunderbird?

As for the human characters, I’m sure everyone has been in love with Eddie Redmayne aka Newt Scamander several months before the premiere but the others deserve at least equal credit – charmingly quirky Queenie, slightly creepy Credence, and Jacob Kowalski, the most likeable muggle – oops, meant No-Maj – you’ll ever meet. You may feel a bit nostalgic about not being able to watch the characters mature as in Harry Potter, but you can enjoy different aspects of the magical world, like the interaction of wizards with the rest of the world, and the struggle they had to go through for their “deviation”. Moreover, with five films in total, you’ll eventually grow up with the characters as well!

Overall impressions? My inner fangirl is screaming incomprehensibly, but even if I should be objective, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is in no way disappointing. Even if you are not fan of Harry Potter, I suggest you give it a go – Fantastic Beasts is trying its best not to be like its older sibling, and it succeeds.
