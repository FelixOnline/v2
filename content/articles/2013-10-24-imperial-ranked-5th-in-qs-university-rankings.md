In September the annual QS university rankings were released, Imperial College London ranked 5th place.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology topped the table for the second year running, achieving a QS score of 100. Harvard took 2nd place, Cambridge was ranked 3rd, University College London was 4th and Imperial was 5th.

Therefore, from the top five rankings in the world, three of the universities are British. Within the top 20, six of the univeristies are British; the other universities are the University of Edinburugh and King’s College London. Switzerland has one and Canada has two in the top 20, the remaining eleven are all American.

It was also found that students that graduate from Oxford and Cambridge are considered the most employable in the world.

Ben Sowter, QS head of research, states that “the brand-name value of Oxbridge has so far survived any negative publicity following the tuition fee hikes and student protests”.
 With the recent Careers Fairs we’ve been having and the ever present marquees hopefully this will give some of you a boost in your step as your approach graduate recruiters, they defintiely want you! - Ed.
