The BBC is no stranger to treating the musical taste buds of music lovers across the capital. Organising what can only be considered the ‘Big Macs’ of musical events, the BBC have continuously jam-packed big names into their events boasting impressive flavours over a whole spectrum of genres. This weekend we are being served with another such experience, and this time it's all meat, no gherkin. 

Brought to us by **BBC Music Introducing Live**, we see three days of live music, industry sessions, and interactive workshops aimed at anyone looking for a career in the music industry: aspiring artists, potential producers, and dreaming DJs alike. Notable names making an appearance at the festival in their various Q&As and masterclasses include: Deadmau5, Example, Kano, You Me At Six, and Jamie Cullum, to name just a few. Not to mention the performances from acts such as Ben Howard, Lady Leshurr, and Nao who will undoubtedly end each day on a high. 

Amazingly, it’s not only artists sharing their expertise over the course of the festival. Industry giants are sending their most informed to shed light on a plethora of topics, including how to get into your chosen musical career (whether that be on the performance side, the broadcasting side, or the marketing side). All while also demonstrating how to look after yourself during the process.

Already established artists such as James Bay have highlighted the importance of **BBC Music Introducing Live**, saying it will always come into where it all started for him. Consequently, it is clear to see that event will form the musical foundation, in not only the expertise but the inspiration, for the next generation’s musical talents. For this reason, I’d urge anyone with an interest in music to check it out. Tickets are still on sale for all three days (08/11/19 – 10/11/18) at  [https://www.introducinglive.co.uk/](https://www.introducinglive.co.uk/). Fortunately, if you can’t make it, _Felix_ will providing the low-down of what happens at the festival.
