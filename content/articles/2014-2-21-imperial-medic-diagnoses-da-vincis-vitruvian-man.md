Imperial surgeon Mr. Hutan Ashrafian has recently diagnosed a picture of Leonardo Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man, saying in an email to the Huffington Post: “I noticed that Leonardo da Vinci’s image of a man had a feature that may have been pathological.

Notably a lump in the left groin region, For an adult male that Leonardo was depicting, a lump in the groin of this nature is most likely diagnosed as a hernia”. The surgeon then went on to suggest that the drawing could have been based on the cadaver of a man who might have died from a hernia. Mr. Ashrafian, a Clinical Lecturer in Surgery has also recently published an academic paper about Arius of Alexandra, the first reported mortality from rectal prolapse.
