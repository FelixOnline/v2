They’re great guilty pleasures, the _Fast and Furious_ films, aren’t they? How can anyone not enjoy having some drinks and a pizza while watching several ripped guys illegally street race and pull off stupid heists? _Fast and Furious_ is simply a very fun, enjoyable set of action films, and – of course – they feature some great car chases. However, my opinion that _Tokyo Drift_ is the best one is apparently some sort of cardinal sin… let’s see if my friends can agree with me on this list at least:

_Blues Brothers (1980)_

There’s actually several big car chases in this 80s classic. The two that really stand out to me are when the brothers completely destroy Dixie Square Mall and, of course, the ending. No film since has packed so much comedy and carnage into such short periods of time. Fun fact – a record (at the time) 103 cars we destroyed in the making of this film.

_The Raid 2 (2014)_

Hey guys, have you heard that I like _The Raid_ films?!? I think I may have mentioned the series a few hundred times in this column alone. In all seriousness though, any list of the best car chases that doesn’t include the incredible highway fight scene in _The Raid 2_ is just objectively inaccurate. I would also recommend watching the horrifically convoluted making-of for this incredible scene.

_Lupin III : The Castle of Cagliostro (1979)_

Hey guys, did you hear that I like Miyazakai films too?!? Oh, right, sorry. At least here I have some big-name back up for my love: Steven Spielberg has famously described the opening car chase of animated classic _The Castle of Cagliostro_ “one of the greatest chase sequence ever filmed”. The jazzy soundtrack here is also a perfect remix of the classic theme to the 70s TV show _Lupin III._
