[photo id=16]

“Yeah, these guys were proper jokers!” The Physics fresher smiles nostalgically as he leafs through a stack of photographs, taken during his travels last year. He recounts the journey that took him across Latin America, the places he visited and the people he met.

In Cuba, he shifted from town to town, sleeping alongside local families and soaking up the culture. In Peru, he immersed himself in the strange, isolated communities of Lake Titicaca, fascinated by their unique lifestyles.

His photographs capture the spirit of this exploration, this uncharted voyage through a young, mysterious continent. Like his photographs, Daniel’s stories burst with detail. In a frank and self-effacing manner, he describes his journey as he experienced it, letting others make of it what they will.
