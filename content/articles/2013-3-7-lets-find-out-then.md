Now, I have a huge confession to make. Well, it’s something that I can’t really help, aside from the non-stop verbal diarrhea. When it began is as misty as a fading memory skipping on old stones in a running brook, but it must have been somewhere in my childhood.

It became my friend, almost always helping me to learn and resulting in those deep meaningful conversations which end up changing your life somewhat. It has a name, perhaps familiar to many yet surrounded in a haze of enigma, unless you’ve been brave enough to reach out to it and go together on a journey.

It has a name, which is ‘why’. In the beginning, it started off with: “Why are the leaves swaying?” “Why is the weather changing?” Then progressed onto the generic “Why can’t I do this? I’m old enough, thank you.” “Why study science when I love art?” “Why can’t everyone hold hands and be happy?” To the rather mature: “Why does the world not make any sense?” Quite rightly too, it doesn’t.

Anyway, there is a spectrum of inquisitiveness; from personal curiosity related to the self and sense of development, to asking questions about how the world works to finding answers that make a positive impact on Earth.

There is a spectrum of inquisitiveness; from personal curiosity related to the self ... to asking questions about how the world works.It is this spectrum of curiosity that keeps me busy on many explorations. If I didn’t understand anything, an almost expedition-like tendency took over. To understand the schizophrenic nature of my primary caregiver, ultimately led to trekking up mountains, meditating and finding every source of fresh holy water – and an increasingly humbled holier-than-thou annoying attitude. Being passionately curious about the environment, a favourite hobby leading to exploring the wilderness and collecting leaf samples, which would then be neatly pressed into handmade cards.

Being a seeker of spirituality, reading about various faiths was never enough; painting about them was not either. I had to visit the holy houses and temples, and irritate many nuns, imams, rabbis, priests and fakirs with my endless questions. I had to visit sacred sites and temples many thousands of years old, to absorb the curiosity of the scared.

Yet, despite all these inquisitive adventures, I still am very much curious about a lot of things. In particularly, I suppose currently about the hormonal nature of the female species, you never know when the tornado is coming. So I duck, just in case.

So, why am I telling you all this? Is to reawaken your innately inquisitive inner child? What’s it to you anyway? Well, in the name of relevancy, a lot actually. Why have you lost that insatiably curious trait you were born with, huh? Why have you stopped watching karate kid and being inspired? Why don’t you think for yourself?

Why don’t you question zeitgeist and society, and empower Earth? Why didn’t you use your own mind when it could’ve mattered? Why don’t you chain yourself to trees in Brazil to save the rainforest? Why don’t you have any questions, anymore? Why are you being patronized by me?

Why am I making these assumptions? Well, I don’t know, perhaps it’s a projection or maybe I need to question some more. Why don’t you begin your curiosity quest?
