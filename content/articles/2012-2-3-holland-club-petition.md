As the results of a feasibility study that will determine the future of [the Holland Club](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/1972/staff-and-students-rally-around-holland-club-campaign/) still remain to be announced, an [e-petition](http://www.change.org/petitions/imperial-college-save-the-holland-club-2) in support of its continuation has received nearly 400 signatories at the time of writing.

The petition letter, addressed to Imperial College, argues against any potential closure, claiming that there will be an “outcry” should any move to remove the Holland Club come to fruition.

The petition follows a [popular Facebook campaign](http://www.facebook.com/savethehollandclub) in support of the Holland Club, which, at the time of writing, has attracted 827 ‘likes’.

The results of the feasibility study are expected within two weeks.
