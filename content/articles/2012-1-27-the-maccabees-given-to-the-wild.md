[The third album](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTDYsy6z6IE) from __The Maccabees__ has been released after much anticipation and to critical acclaim. Sorry, “much” anticipation? Critically acclaimed by who now?

Things are expected to change for the Maccabees. Their new single has had airplay on national daytime radio and the new album has had plenty of press coverage; but when it comes down to it, is the music strong enough to turn The Maccabees into the new __Coldplay__ or __Muse__?

Coming from one of their biggest fans who has been following them since before they had even released a single record, the answer is simply no.

Judging the LP alone, it is spectacular. Dark yet warm, sweet without being sickly, it has a huge sound while maintaining an intimate, personal feel. Orlando Weeks sings with such tenderness that his voice sometimes cannot be distinguished from the music. This is no bad thing: it demonstrates the ability of the band to ensure that their instruments have significance and do not solely act as a support for his voice.

The overall vibe is one of maturity. Not only in comparison to their infantile earlier releases and the fact that it will not be just 15 year olds listening, but lyrically explores the idea of being [_Given to the Wild_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTDYsy6z6IE), having to grow up, and the temporary nature of the life we grow up for. The amazing thing is that it matches style of their music, so much so that when you listen you feel that unnerving feeling: the one where you realise that you are maturing every second of every day, and you finally realise who you are becoming.

However, albums will never be judged alone, and the fact is The Maccabees are not underrated and have not produced anything to label them as such. It is a beautiful album and will no doubt be one of my favourites of 2012, but as I fan I hope that it is not the album which defines the Maccabees, because they are a great band with the potential to do so much more. Plus, the finale of final song ‘Grew up at Midnight’ sounds exactly like that of ‘[Sea Within a Sea](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1lD5cE6Bwc)’ by __The Horrors__.
