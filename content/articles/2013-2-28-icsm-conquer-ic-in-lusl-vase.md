Following talk of an unbeaten season following three wins from three games at the start of the season, the ICSM FC 2nd XI had taken a nose dive. A string of losses left Captain Ali Brown and his men dejected and in desperate need of a win. A quarter final tie against rivals, IC 5th XI, in the LUSL Vase, was cited as the perfect opportunity to turn our fortunes around.

In truth, we medics could not say we played to the best of our ability and IC may even argue they had the better of the game for periods of the initial ninety minutes. However their ‘cynical’ football just simply wasn’t clinical enough and neither side could break the deadlock by the time the referee blew for the end of normal time. A rallying talk from the aforementioned skipper sent the future life-savers out onto the field with real determination. Finally our quality prevailed and the deadlock was broken thanks to this correspondent. After stealing the ball from a teammate I was delighted to net my first goal for the club and subsequently let out a Stuart Pearce-esque cry of delight and relief. I gladly netted a second to put the game beyond doubt and the final whistle was met with ecstasy from the boys in red. We had actually won a game, and it felt great.

So, after a bye, a walkover, and a scrappy win over a defiant IC team, the 2s are into the semis of the ‘infamous’ Vase.
