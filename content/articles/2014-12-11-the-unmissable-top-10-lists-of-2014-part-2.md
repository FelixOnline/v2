__2014 will surely go down as a vintage year for cinema. The slight delay in release dates between the US and the UK meant that we began the year with a spate of Academy Award nominees – and eventual winners – including Steve McQueen’s _12 Years A Slave_, Martin Scorsese’s _The Wolf of Wall Street_, and Spike Jonze’s _Her_. To many it seemed like the year had peaked too early, and that nothing would live up to the films released in these first couple of months; they were wrong.__

__In particular 2014 was a year of return for a number of directors who had been absent for a while; the Coen brothers delighted with their sharp, pithy film _Inside Llewyn Davis_, which was centred around the Greenwich Village folk scene of the 1960s; Mike Leigh made a welcome return to the screen after a four year absence with his biopic _Mr Turner_, in which Timothy Spall gave a performance of a lifetime as the seminal British painter, picking up a Best Actor award at Cannes; and Wes Anderson brought his trademark symmetry back into the cinema with _The Grand Budapest Hotel_, a snappy candybox of a film that featured a procession of celebrity cameos and taught us that Ralph Fiennes was actually extremely funny. Not to forget Joanna Hogg’s _Exhibition_, in which the breakdown of a relationship is explored in an unsettlingly surreal manner.__

__And it was not the UK/US film industries that proved successful this year. Pawel Pawłikowski’s _Ida_ was an unforeseen masterpiece; with its monochromatic palette, jazzy soundtrack, and idiosyncratic framing style, it was like watching Poland through a _Nouvelle Vague_ lens. From across the channel we had the Dardenne brother’s _Two Days, One Night_, in which Marion Cotillard cemented her reputation as a jewel in French cinema’s crown, and _Stranger By The Lake_, a shimmering, Hitchcockian mirage of a film that blended horror and homoeroticism.__

__But the main showdown this year took place between two diametrically opposite films, perhaps representing the head and the heart. On the side of the heart we had_ Boyhood_, Richard Linklater’s epic tale of a boy’s childhood and adolescence; filmed over a period of twelve years, it seemed both as intimate as a whispered secret and as broad as a Texan sky. Watching Mason grow up in front of our very eyes, from queuing up at a Harry Potter book launch to drinking his first beer, Boyhood acts both as a celebration of youth and a clear-eyed reminder of a childhood past.__

__However good _Boyhood _may have been, for me it was just beaten by the British sci-fi film _Under the Skin_, in which Jonathan Glazer had Scarlett Johansson wander around Scotland as an extra-terrestrial. With an almost clinical logic to it, _Under the Skin_ is as cold and unforgiving as deep space; from its visuals, to its camerawork, to the acting talent, _Under the Skin_ is nothing short of a masterpiece, not to mention its breathtaking, brutal soundtrack from composer Mica Levi. A brilliant exploration of alienation, modern isolation, and the folly of humanity, Under the Skin absolutely captivates, dragging you down into its icy depths.__
