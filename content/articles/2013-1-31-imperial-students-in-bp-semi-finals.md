Imperial students have made it through to the [BP Ultimate Field Trip semi-final](http://www.bp.com/extendedsectiongenericarticle.do?categoryId=9044170&contentId=7077247)s. Five Imperial teams, each with three engineering students have reached the semi-finals stage, which will be held on the 4th-5th February across the UK.

Emma Judge, BP Head of UK Graduate Resourcing commented: “We’re really impressed with the standard of entries this year and it’s great to see so many teams from different universities getting involved. We hope the semi-finalists are enjoying the challenge and we wish everyone the best of luck.”

The Ultimate Field Trip is the UK’s flagship student competition; it enables some of the brightest individuals studying STEM subjects to work in teams and answer a real life business challenge. The winning team receives a 2 week international field trip with BP. The team that wins this year will complete their internship during the summer holidays; where they will be travelling to Stavanger in Norway, Shetland Isles, off the coast of Scotland and the International Centre of Business & Technology in London.

These teams are solving this year’s challenge, where they are required to “Develop a single technical innovation, which has previously not been demonstrated, to significantly reduce the cost of PKT per capita in your country by 2030”. Where the “innovation can focus on one mode of passenger transportation from road, rail, water or air, or you can use a combination of each. The solution you develop must be technology-focused, practical and innovative.”

Imperial students regularly get through to the latter half of the competition.
