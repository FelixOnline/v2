If easy home cooking is not really for you, then youâ€™re blessed that we are in one of the most culturally diversed cities in the world, but Chinatown is not your only option either!
SCR & QTR

TasteImperial is serving Chinese specialities at their outlets on Friday. In SCR, the classic five spice chicken and crispy pork is available in the SCR, along with coconut cake and sponge cake. You can also get stir-fry and chow mein at the QTR. Free fortune cookies are offered there and also when you get the meal deal at F-East in the JCR.
Yam Yam! Festival

Yam Yam! is a 15-day festival (the duration of Chinese New Year celebration) at south-east London which consists of workshops and food around the world!
All ingredients used in the food served are sourced locally and all waste is recycled on site since they aim to become zero waste to landfill by the end of 2014. So definitely a place to go for a fun weekend while enjoying some guilt-free yummy food!
