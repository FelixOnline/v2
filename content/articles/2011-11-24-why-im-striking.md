“I will be striking on N30. It’s absolutely outrageous cutting pensions. I do feel ambivalent; to forfeit a wadge of money, when my wage is very low does worry me greatly, however, what they are doing is obscene. It is outrageous pensions are not protected, they’re not fantastic anyway. You work the best years of your life for the pensions, which are then attacked, it’s morally wrong to attack our pensions. I’d like to do something meaningful and valuable, I think I’ll picket the library and town hall. It seems really important to do something meaningful with the time. “

__Susan Appleton, Library Assistant, London__

“I’m striking and angry. The spineless gits are attacking the pensions of average earners in a thinly veiled tactic to reduce the deficit that we didn’t cause. They even changed the offer to cost us more in the short term but promising more long term, condemning future governments whilst making money for theirs.”

__James Sheehan, Science Teacher, Liverpool__

“I’m currently unemployed after finishing my master’s degree, so I can’t strike in the traditional way of stopping work, however I will be outside my local Job Centre and picketing there in order to demand better welfare provision and meaningful jobs. Just because strikes are traditionally associated with workers does not mean that the unemployed cannot take part and demand rights for themselves, in fact, it is absolutely vital that we take a stand. The situation for us is appalling – not only is there a great deal of stigma linked with claiming unemployment benefits (as if the individual is choosing to be unemployed) rather than realising that it could happen to anyone – but the amount you are given to survive on is an insult. Just look at the present climate with thousands of jobs being cut – it is clearly not an individual’s fault if they find themselves out of work. I hope that N30 will see millions take to the streets against this government sending a clear message that we do not accept their cuts.”

__Elizabeth Milne, Unemployed, London__
