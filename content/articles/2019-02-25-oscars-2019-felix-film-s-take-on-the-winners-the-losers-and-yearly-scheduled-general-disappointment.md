**Best Picture**

_Academy Prediction:_

_Probably_ Green Book _or_ The Favourite

_What we want to win: I’d want to see_ Roma _win, personally; maybe it might?_
BlacKkKlansman _probably would win if this were ten years ago. Anything except_ A Star is Born.

The nominees for Best Picture are arguably the most diverse they have ever been, nominating films about people of colour and films featuring non-white actors in lead roles. One of the nominees is _Black Panther,_ the first superhero film to be nominated—but its inclusion has been controversial. Is the Academy blatantly ticking boxes for the wrong reasons? Perhaps. Does it actually stand a chance? Perhaps not. 

_Roma_ certainly will leave the other nominees quaking in their seats, but no “foreign language film” has ever won the award for Best Picture—could this be the year? Alfonso Cuaron’s incredible film about a housemaid in 1970s Mexico City is thoroughly worthy. The safe choice is _BlaKkKlansman,_ the story about a black undercover police officer infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan. It’s impressively ballsy, zesty and unflinchingly humorous. A deserving film that’s made with a fistful of passion. _- SSM_

**Animated Feature Film**

![](https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/felixonline/2018_felix_issues/issue_1715/1715_film_spidey.jpg)

_Academy Prediction:_ Spiderman: Enter the Spiderverse _or_ The Incredibles 2.

_What we want to win: Any of them, although_ The Boss Baby: Back in Business _was snubbed of a nom/win._

This year’s Animated Feature Film category is the most stacked we’ve seen in recent history. Not only do we have the long awaited sequel to _The Incredibles,_ but also an actually great _Spiderman_ movie with beautiful art and great story that spawned a cult following.

And that’s not all, an entry from renowned Wes Anderson, with _Isle of Dogs,_ and the first non Studio Ghibli anime ever to be nominated for the category, _Mirai,_ is coming up closely behind.

With the “weakest” showing of the bunch being the sequel to _Wreck-it Ralph, Ralph Breaks the Internet,_ which itself is a fantastic family movie, and pretty flawless start to finish, it just puts into perspective just how high quality the nominees are this year.

Although it would be nice to see _Mirai_ dethrone Studio Ghibli as an Anime Oscar winner, it just doesn’t quite hit the same high notes as _Enter the Spiderverse,_ nor does it have the nostalgic hype that comes with _The Incredibles 2_. 

No matter which way it goes, it’s safe to say it won’t be a disappointing result. _-MD_

**Directing**

![](https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/felixonline/2018_felix_issues/issue_1715/1715_film_roma.jpg)

_Academy Prediction: Alfonso Cuaron or close second Yorgos Lanthimos_

_What we want to win: Another case of if_ BlacKkKlansman _were made ten years ago Spike Lee would take it, otherwise it’ll be nice to see Yorgos Lanthimos take it._

Alfonso Cuaron is surely the strongest candidate in the list of nominees, winning this category at the BAFTAs and at the Golden Globes. _Roma_ was exceptionally directed—from the flare of fluidity in the way the camera scans the scene, to getting the incredible performances from the actors. Yorgos Lanthimos (The Favourite) could potentially grab a steal at the final hurdle, but he would need to sell his soul to Harvey Weinstein. And on that topic, no women directors were nominated this year. Apparently, you can’t use more than one diversity coupon in conjunction with another. _-SSM_

Adam McKay picked up a nomination for direction alongside multiple other nominations for _Vice,_ even with the lukewarm reaction from American reviewers.

What is good to see is the Academy didn’t follow the BAFTAS in a Bradley Cooper nomination, which although has been marked as a snub, isn’t at all deserving. _-MD_
 
**Foreign Language**

![](https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/felixonline/2018_felix_issues/issue_1715/1715_film_shoplift.jpg)

_Academy Prediction:_ Roma _or_ Shoplifters.

_What we want to win: It would be good to see_ Shoplifters _pick up another deserved big win, but_ Roma _and_ Cold War _are equally deserved._

Foreign language this year is not only picking up nominations in this category but all over the Oscars. 

With Paweł Pawlikowski’s breathtaking _Cold War,_ picking up nominations for Direction and Cinematography alongside it’s best Foreign Language, it stands a strong contender the win.

As well as this, Hirokazu Kore-eda’s _Shoplifters_ has been picking up a lot of awards at different ceremonies, including the Palme d’Or for its heart wrenching look into a life in poverty.

Although the competition is tough going up against Alfonso Cuaron’s black and white, critically acclaimed, Netflix masterpiece, _Roma,_ it will be interesting to see if Netflix distributed and Netflix originals start to pick up more awards at prestigious ceremonies like this, even after the academy’s general distaste to the online streaming platform. 

It’s hard to gauge who will win overall with such a strong trio, winning a multitude of awards across lots of ceremonies. My heart lies with _Shoplifters,_ but my money’s on Roma. _-MD_

**Best Actor in a Leading Role**

![](https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/felixonline/2018_felix_issues/issue_1715/1715_film_chrisbale.jpg)

_Academy Prediction: Rami Malek or Viggo Mortensen_

_What we want to win: There is nothing that has stuck with me more than old fat Christian Bale, anything but Bradley Cooper._

Rami Malek took home the BAFTA and the Golden Globe for his performance in _Bohemian Rhapsody_. On top of that, it seems the Oscars really, really, really like _Bohemian Rhapsody_ this year, so it’s going to be tough to edge out Rami Malek. _-SSM_

When it comes down to who I don’t want to see win, it is a no brainer with Bradley Cooper. William Dafoe’s performance was relatively forgettable; Rami Malek and Christian Bale both did good jobs at impersonation; Viggo Mortensen was fine. It’s not a good lineup this year. _-MD_

**Cinematography**

_Academy Prediction:_ Roma

_What we want to win:_ Roma _or_ Cold War.

Cinematography is a hard category this year, with not one, but two black and white films praised at multiple festivals for their use of colour. It’s going to be hard to predict, but very likely one of _Roma_ or _Cold War_. _-MD_ 

**Costume Design**

_Academy Prediction:_ The Favourite _or_ Black Panther.

_What we want to win:_ Black Panther

This is a hard judge. On one hand the Academy loves period drama costuming, and the nominees are ripe, however _Black Panther_ bought something that deviates from the western centric norm. _-MD_

**Best Actor in a Supporting Role**

![](https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/felixonline/2018_felix_issues/issue_1715/1715_film_green.jpg)

_Academy Prediction: Mahershala Ali_

_What we want to win: Sam Rockwell being able to portray George Bush to that level of accuracy is definetly something that should be awarded, but we’d like to see Mahershala Ali win._

Mahershala Ali already has a Best Supporting Actor to his name, from his performance in _Moonlight,_ back in 2016. The performances of Ali and Viggo Mortensen elevates _Green Book_ into more than the sum of its parts. Solidifying Ali as top candidate in my mind._-SSM_ 

Sam Rockwell and his impression of George W. Bush in _Vice_ really captivates the slimyness of the real thing and that can’t be ignored as a outstanding performance. Adam Driver falls in a similar category with a performance that can’t be ignored but I feel they both fall just short of Mahershala Ali. _- MD_

**Best Actress in a Leading Role**

![](https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/felixonline/2018_felix_issues/issue_1715/1715_film_yalita.jpg)

_Academy Prediction: Olivia Coleman_

_What we want to win: We’d like to see Olivia Coleman continue winning awards, but failing that, Yalitza Aparicio for_ Roma _is great._

Olivia Coleman is the most likely candidate here, picking up awards all over the shop. Glenn Close has a chance, Aidan gave a glowing review for _The Wife_ and especially Glenn Close. _-SSM_

In my mind, there is a very clear winner for me, and that’s Yalitza Aparicio, there is no overlooking her performance in _Roma,_ and she deserves to take home the Oscar.

Knowing the Academy however I have strong feelings that Olivia Coleman will take the win, deservedly, but still in the shadow of Aparicio’s performace. _-MD_

**Make-up and Hairstyling**

_Academy Prediction:_ Vice 

_What we want to win:_ Vice.

Despite how talented the other makeup and hairstyling is, especially Mary Queen of Scots, this category is a no brainer for me. It just has to be Christian Bale’s unbelievable transformation in _Vice_. _-MD_ 

**Music (Score and Song)**

_Academy Prediction:_ Isle of Dogs (Score) _and_ All the Stars (Song)

_What we want to win: See above._

Will Kendrick Lamar pick up an Oscar? It’s likely. _Isle of Dogs_ definitely deserves the best score. _-MD_ 

**Best Actress in a Supporting Role**

![](https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/felixonline/2018_felix_issues/issue_1715/1715_film_regina.jpg)

_Academy Prediction: Rachel Weisz or Emma Stone_

_What we want to win: Regina King or Marina de Tavira for both of their stellar performances do deserve to pick up the Oscar, if there were two awards, they deserve both._

Rachel Weisz/ Emma Stone. One of them from _The Favourite_ is bound to win; it’s just statistically more likely. Friendly competition, but Weisz took home the BAFTA for Best Supporting Actress, and so is edging ahead. It’s going to be a close one. _-SSM_ 

Regina King picked up one of the unfortunately few nominations for _If Beale Street Could Talk,_ and she definitely deserves it. In an ideal world either she or  Marina de Tavira would pick up the world, but looking at previous award ceremonies, it looks like _The Favourite_ is going to pick up another award here. _-MD_
