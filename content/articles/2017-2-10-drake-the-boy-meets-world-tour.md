     Cainllg all cars, calling all cars, we're ready to make a deal.,Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors, for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5% in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page on yo

Desiigner’s Panda played in the O2 arena as I sat high up waiting for Drake to take to the stage, so high up that I genuinely had a nosebleed during the show. I couldn’t help but overhear the comments of the girls sitting beside me. “I’m so glad they made a song about my favourite animal”, one said whilst her friend dabbed a bit too enthusiastically. I find myself switching from Drizzy fan boy to Drizzy hater on a regular basis. How many hip-hop artists could sell out the O2 for so many dates? On the other hand, his music has infiltrated the mainstream to such an extent that his core fan base is starting to consist largely of a group that don’t appreciate many other hip-hop artists. Is this good for the culture?

All of my questions disappeared as soon as the lights dimmed and the horns of Trophies started to blear. What ensued was an hour and a half of pure energy, with the six god rattling off tune after tune, and the crowd eating up every second of it. From performing the hooks of classic hits such as Headlines, Over and The Motto to more recent bangers, including Fake Love and Hotline Bling, Drake’s enthusiasm had onlookers jumping all night.

Drake flexed his vocals on the slower, more romantic Find Your Love and Feel No Ways, and well as the more upbeat Work and Too Good. He proclaimed, “You know you have to play the RiRi tunes to make the gyal dem feel sexy”. He switched up the vibe throughout, sensing when to play his more upbeat songs yelling, “I’m tryna do a show for the people, I ain’t tryna fuck nobody right now!” at his keyboard player.

Drake’s obsession with London and the UK grime scene was evidenced as he brought London’s Dave, Giggs and Kyla out to join him on stage, much to the audience’s excitement. Dave joined forces with Drake to perform their hit single, Wanna Know Remix. Giggs was the next guest, performing Whippin Excursion, and making Aubrey go full fan boy for the five minutes that he was on stage.

In a brief intermission, we were treated to a preview of a Drake and Giggs’ collaboration and a giant light-up globe rose through the centre of the stage. Drake returned to the stage to perform Pop Style leading nicely into Know Yourself. The crowd went off as Drake screamed “I was running through the six with my woes” and it was by far the most hyped part of the of the show. Drake ended the show declaring, “If I die, Imma die a legend”.
