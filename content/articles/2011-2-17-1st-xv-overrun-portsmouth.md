The 1st XV travelled down to Portsmouth on Wednesday eager to maintain their challenge for promotion against a side that are extremely difficult to beat at home.

The match began with fly half James Hayward rocked by three late hits by the Portsmouth openside in sequential plays. Portsmouth’s repeated ill discipline around the field allowed Imperial to capitalise on penalties through their superior line out and subsequent mauls. Charlie Esberger, Chris McGeough and Ed Labinksi provided safe and secure line out options. The breakthrough came mid-way through the first half with a try finished off by Louie Barnett after good work in the tight from the forwards. Hayward added the conversion and a penalty before half time to give Imperial a respectable lead at the turn around given that Imperial had defended for most of the first half, leading by example was returning captain Caolan Cotter.

Following the restart, Imperial carried on where they left off, man of the match George Lane and his centre partner Ben Adubi looked comfortable in attack and defence whilst Joe Harris and Jack Newton on the wings threatened when given the opportunity. Hayward added another penalty before Toby Spittle, on for Jamie ‘S&M’ Aldridge, charged over for a second try after good vision from replacement scrum half Olly Cox, who replaced the ineffectual Graeme Riddler. The third try was simply a collective effort from the front row. Simon Fenton stole an overthrown lineout and charged into the opposition 22 before offloading to Spittle who had the vision to see hooker, David Wilson, rampaging down the touchline to score in the corner. Hayward added the conversion to end the day with a perfect kicking record.

Imperial hope to carry such intensity into their remaining games this season.
