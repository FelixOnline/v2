     Irreversible: still a better love story than Twilight.,yeah the human centipede 2 was one fucked up film! can think of a few others to avoid on dates, the devils rejects, funny games, the strangers, ichi the killer, teeth, caligula,boys dont cry,hostel,saw,crash,natural born killers,romper stomper,I saw the 1st human centipede and that was pretty rough. Not looking forward to seeing the 2nd one but it'll probably happen when I'm hungover from a party the night before and I'm on the couch with my roommate and nothing on TV :P. I don't really agree with your honorable mentions, (Fatal Attraction, Titanic, Last House on the Left, Misery, Requiem for a Dream, American Psycho.) The other ones you listed I don't find terrible, just not great. And yes the Fast and Furious is as boring as watching NASCARS make 500 continuous left turns for 3 hours :)

__The Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence__

If you’ve seen the first Human Centipede film, you may well have been pretty disgusted. It wasn’t nice, was it? But this one is worse. This story follows Martin Lomax, a depraved maniac obsessed with the first film, and his insane urge to create a twelve-person ‘centipede’. You can imagine how it goes. This movie has not been released into any UK viewing format: the British Board of Film Classification deemed it “undoubtedly tasteless and disgusting”.

__The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1__

Vampires, werewolves, vampires having a minor disagreement with werewolves, a bit of running, a bit of slow motion vampire-y jumping, a girl pregnant with a vampire-human hybrid monster, said girl’s pregnancy craving being a nice cup of blood... yep, this is a spectacular film. Not only will the love interests (and I use the term ‘interests’ lightly) bore the pants of all parties, but the strobe lighting and reasonably graphic birth scene are likely to make some feel dizzy.

__Irreversible__

Directed by Gaspar Noé, this French film was released in UK cinemas without much question, although admittedly with an 18 certificate. This is surprisingly lenient considering a hugely graphic rape scene which goes on for what seems like many uncomfortable hours, not to mention some spectacularly extreme and gory death-by-fire-extinguisher-bludgeoning. Certainly not the best date film by any means.

__La Belle Noiseuse__

Seriously – any film in which we can see the fantastically gorgeous Emmanuelle Béart standing totally starkers for two hours while modeling for a painting, should not be a boring film. Unfortunately, the film is four hours long... and the other two consist of close-ups of the painter at work. So not only are you parading naked lady in front of your date, you are also boring her rigid. I mean, at least have Béart do star-jumps, or something.
