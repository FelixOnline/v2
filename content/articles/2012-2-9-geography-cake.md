__Ingredients__
 3 eggs
 3 glasses of self raising flour
 3⁄4 glass of sugar
 3⁄4 glass of oil
 1 glass of milk
 3 tsp of Baking Powder
 1 tbsp of cognac
 2 tbsp of Drinking Chocolate

Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F. Beat the oil and the sugar together until smooth. Whisk the eggs and add them to the previous mixture. Add the milk, the baking powder and the cognac and keep whisking. Once the mixture is ready, add the flour and stir until fully combined. Grease a baking tin with butter or oil and pour half of the mixture in it. Pour the drinking chocolate in the other half and stir. Add it in the baking tin on top of the previous mixture and bake for almost 45 minutes. Leave the cake to cool before you remove it from the tin.

Top tip : Do not open the oven before the first 20 minutes, if you want your cake to rise properly.
