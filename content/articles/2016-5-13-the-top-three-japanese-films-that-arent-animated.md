Two weeks ago I  slagged off the French film-making philosophy. In an effort to be more positive this week, I’m going to heap praise on my favourite film-producing country – Japan. Looking past the endlessly churned out anime crap, animated Japanese cinema may very well be the best in the world. – Miyazaki, Katsuhiro Ôtomo and Mamoru Hosoda are unmatched in the eyes of many critics. But it would be nice for live action films get a look in:

_Tokyo Sonata (2008)_

When reviewing the French ‘style’ of filmmaking I commented on its annoying fascination with endless dialogue and rich young people’s tiresome love lives. No film shows off the vastly superior Japanese filmmaking philosophy as _Tokyo Sonata_. Much like a modern-day _Tokyo Story_, the film is a classic Japanese slice-of-life drama focused on family and appreciating small things in life.

_13 Assassins (2010)_

Much like _Tokyo Sonata_ is a modern-day, version of the classic _Tokyo Story_, _13 Assassins_ represents a new-and-improved version of _Seven Samurai_. It tells the classic story of an elite team taking on hordes of bad-guys threatening a poor village, with everything ramped up to 11. _Seven Samurai_ may be the critic’s favourite but never try to challenge Takeshii Mike on violent spectacle.

_Departures (2008)_

I’m surprised that I’ve never spoken about _Departures_ before.  The problem is that it’s hard to describe it in a way that does justice to how beautiful and life affirming it is. It tells of a newly unemployed cellist who takes up a job preparing the dead for their funerals. The film is hugely intelligent and uniquely emotional. It explores the topics of death, family, and Japanese sensibilities better than any other film I have ever seen.
