Imperial president Professor Alice Gast has been chosen as a non-executive member of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). She is one of twelve board appointments recently announced by science minister Jo Johnson. 

UKRI, which will formally come into being in April 2018, seeks to develop the strength of its constituent research councils, Innovate UK, and new council Research England. It will advise on budget allocation  (including the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund) to maximise the benefits of the government’s annual £6 billion investment in research. 

UKRI lists its objectives as pushing the “frontiers of human knowledge” and creating economic and social impact. Documents published by UKRI also claim the UK produces a “disproportionate percentage of the world’s top research” which must be better translated into commercial outcomes. 
This focus on the economy is made clear by the high proportion of business leaders on the board. 
UKRI has said it will push for quality and competition and stick to the Haldane principle (i.e. researchers will decide where funds are directed, not politicians). 

Professor Gast said: “UKRI aims to be the best research and innovation organisation in the world and will play a critical role in making sure we have an environment where research and innovation will flourish. I look forward to working with the science minister and my colleagues on the board to support our world-leading institutions as we push the boundaries of discovery for the benefit of all in our society.”

Johnson said: “UKRI has a pivotal role in our future as a knowledge economy. This is an exceptionally strong board that will ensure the UK’s world-leading research system stays at the frontier of science and innovation for decades to come.”
