When listening to those words in the title immediately we all think of deserted cities with one main road, as these places were presented in the Western movies. This might be true for some places, though this article will present some nature’s most famous creations, namely the Canyons and the national parks within which they are located.

Yes, most of you I am sure know about the Grand Canyon, that is why I am going to omit it from this article, and will try to shed some light to those least known ones, which I truly admired on my trip there.

The US states where most of these canyons can be found are Arizona, Utah and Nevada. The first one I am going to mention is Bryce Canyon located in Utah within the Kodachrome State Park. At this canyon one has the opportunity to stay within the State Park in the so called “Red Stone” Cabins. You can then admire the magnitude of this canyon throughout different times of the day and notice the change in the colour of the rocks. One can walk through the different designated paths to understand what this place has to offer and admire what nature has created, and see something that is still pretty un-influenced from humans. The scenery is truly majestic. I am not particularly fond of adventure trips, but this place brought out a different site of me.

The next one on my list is Zion National Park, also located in Utah, which is one of the longest canyons covering a distance of 24 km. The rangers in the park have organised buses that take you from the visitor center to the end of the trail at the so called “Temple of Sinawava”. At each stop along the way one can get off the bus and follow the designated trails to experience nature’s magnitude first hand. This canyon is the easiest one to reach and explore, especially for a beginner hiker.

The final canyon that has literally blown my mind is the “Antelope Canyon”, located in Page Arizona. What is striking about this canyon is that it is located under the ground. One can enter this canyon only with a guide, who also explains how it was created and tries to really integrate you into the scenery. Truth is this canyon is completely different any other canyon that I have visitied, and is worth a look. Words really fail me when describing this canyon; I think for once I will let pictures speak for themselves.

In these places don’t expect to find extreme luxuries, but expect to be amazed by nature’s luxuries. If you want to escape the humdrum of everyday hectic life, then these places are ideal for you and for your hidden adventurous site…
