The Musical Theatre Society (MTSoc) ended their Autumn season last week with an all-singing, all-dancing musical revue. _Carrying The Banner _featured numbers from a spectrum of different musicals and cabaret acts, including _Wicked_ and _Avenue Q_.

This is the third consecutive year in which MTSoc has abandoned any pretence of a storyline to allow society members to try directing and choreographing without the pressure of a full show. Additionally, this year there were a number of musical directors from the A Cappella society and the Royal College of Music.

Over 300 people attended the three day run, which played to full houses on Thursday and Friday night.

Rehearsals began in mid-October, directly following the October show,_ Acting! _With many of the cast having only just joined the society, the pressure was on, and a minimum of 12 hours of rehearsal every week kept everyone busy. During the two weeks preceding the show, there was rehearsal or a band call every day.

The Artistic Director, Harriet Campbell, praised the cast’s motivation and good spirit, saying “They’re my favourite cast ever… not just because they’re _my_ cast.”

_Next term, MTSoc will present their Spring Show, Merrily We Roll Along by Stephen Sondheim. Auditions continue to run next week; contact musicaltheatre@imperial.ac.uk for more details._
