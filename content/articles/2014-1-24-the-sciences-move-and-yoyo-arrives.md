This week has seen the announcement of the departurew of the Science Museum library and the launch of Yoyo, a new mobile payments app rolled out at Imperial over the last week.

There are certainly many sad souls who will miss the SM library, it’s dusty old books full of historical facts and figures, and it’s journals on the history of sewage (no, not swag), in London.

Fortunately there is still ample oportunity to loan books form the British Library, which only a short no. 10 bus ride away, as well as other university libraries within London.

What will be exciting is seeing what will happen to the space the library vacates, will it be filled with more books, iPads or a lush cinema suite for the times when you really need to compare the contents of your microfiche to that episode of CSI on that DVD you bought from Amazon.

On the other hand, as they say, out with the old and in with the new! While we see the imminent departure of the Science Museum library we also have some fun Yoyo activity to look forward to.

Well, fine, paying for items is never fun, but some of our staff have certainly seen some speedy payments using the app, despite it’s lovely pink background. Even the Editor admits that it’s much faster to use than fumbling for cash at the checkout, let alone counting all his pennies and five pence coins to purchase that sushi snack from the JCR!

Fear not, this is not recless promotion, mearly a slighly over-excitied newspaper that likes having a cashless lunch. All they have to do next is amend the app to be compatible with buying rounds at the Union and Yoyo and Felix will get on just fine.

Aside form that, and the embarassing Civil Engineering muck up that happened on the Victoria line, we hope you have a nice week!
