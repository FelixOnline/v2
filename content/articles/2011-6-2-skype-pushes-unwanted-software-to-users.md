Skype users might want to keep an eye out when installing updates on their system after users noticed that the application was attempting to foist software from another company on them. [Skype was found requesting access to an application called ‘easybitsgo.exe](http://www.blogtechnical.com/1115/skype-installs-game-crapware-on-your-systems-without-users-prior-knowledge.bt)’, produced by EasyBits, a company specialising in game apps. While not essentially malware, the software was pushed to user computers without their permission. Skype then confirmed that the program [‘neither installs nor un-installs correctly’](http://blogs.skype.com/garage/2011/05/easybits_update_disabled_for_s.html), a remarkable feat in this modern age. The update has been disabled so there’s no need to worry about picking it up now, but if you unquestioningly accepted a third-party update request on Windows over the past few days you may want to double-check your system. A helpful guide on locating and removing the software can be found [here](http://bit.ly/m31XqC).
