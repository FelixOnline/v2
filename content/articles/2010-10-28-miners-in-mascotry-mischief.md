City and Guilds College Union (CGCU) suffered a spanner in the works after a night out at the Archangel club, in which a covert operation was planned to then whisk the beloved mascot, "Spanner", into a high-security compound. However, their plans were foiled by a student of the Royal School of Mines (RSM) who knicked it from under their noses. Now the waiting game begins as the CGCU nervously expect the ransom. A ransom note has been sent to CGCU demanding the following; Firstly that a sum of Â£200 is paid to RAG, that CGCU 'sort themselves out as a committee and get functioning like a proper union' and a barrel of Becks behind the RSM bar.

Mercifully, "Bolt", the faithful companion of "Spanner" was left so as to not completely crush the CGCU's morale. RAG Chair Naida Dzigal stated, "It is refreshing to see that Imperial students engage in activities outside of their courses and even more to see them doing these with a sense of Imperial spirit". Will RAG receive their ransom? Will CGCU ever see their treasured mascot again? All will be revealed on November 1st.
