On Wednesday 18th February the first _Imperial Questions Live_ show will be broadcast. The first live show to be broadcast from the newly refurbished Media Suite which Imperial College Union redeveloped over the Summer, the show will be following a _Question Time_ style format. Questions submitted in advance by members of the Imperial community will act as starting points for panel discussion. Members of the audience will also be able to add their views and opinions to the debate. Viewers at home will be able to stream it live, and contribute to the debate with the hashtag [\#IQL](https://twitter.com/hashtag/iql) on Twitter.

The panel will consist of: Tom Wheeler (Imperial College Union President), Philippa Skett (Felix Editor), Debra Humphris (Vice Provost, Education - the most senior member of staff solely responsible for students and the college’s education provision), Oli Benton (Athletics Clubs Committee Chair - he looks after over forty sports clubs at Imperial) and Bridge Duncombe (the first full time Director of Undergraduate Studies in Chemistry, who is credited by students for dramatically improving their department in a short period of time).

> Philippa Skett, Felix Editor

On being invited to the panel, Philippa Skett said “I think this is a great opportunity for discussion and debate beyond formal structures like Union Council, which (understandably) don’t get much engagement beyond Council members themselves. Hopefully we can demystify a few issues I know a lot of students want to know more about. And for me personally, whilst I engage in the Union’s membership through _Felix_, this gives an opportunity to even discuss _Felix_ itself with people who I may not normally reach out to."

Media Group Chair Cem Hurrell was looking forward to the event, saying “Imperial Questions Live should be an excellent showcase for the new Media Suite, and engage a broad audience. It fits in well with our plans for the term: a few weeks after we will broadcast _Meet the Candidates_, the live show where we interview candidates running in the Union’s__ __Big Elections. _Questions Live_ is incredibly promising, and I hope this will become a termly event."

The broadcast will start at 7pm on Wednesday 18th February on the [ICTV website](http://imperialcollege.tv/), and the [form is open](http://imperialcollege.tv/questions-live/) for questions to be submitted. They welcome any contribution from the college community.
