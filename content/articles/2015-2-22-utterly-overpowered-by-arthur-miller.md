I have a confession to make. In my ignorance, I know practically nothing about Arthur Miller. Arguably one of the greatest playwrights of the twentieth century, at least a superficial understanding of Miller’s work should probably be expected from me, but not even that can I offer. Clueless, but with great anticipation, it was in this mind-set that I walked into the __Wyndham’s Theatre__ for their production of _A View from the Bridge_.

One of Miller’s early works, the play portrays the relationship between Italian American longshoreman Eddie Carbone and his orphaned niece Catherine. Set in 1950s Brooklyn, two of Carbone’s cousins arrive illegally from impoverished Sicily. The strong silent Marco contrasts the lavish, platinum blond Rodolpho who, falling in love with Catherine, unearths a deep seated jealously and unease in Eddie. A tragedy in which each character draws sympathy from the tense audience, this is unlike anything I have seen before. With no one individual to label the villain, an overwhelming agitation builds throughout the performance.

Mark Strong’s piercing eyes are a sight to behold. Imposing and powerful, Strong’s immaculate focus and complete dedication to his role as Eddie is not only completely convincing but also builds a beautifully sympathetic character whose desire for respect and loyalty hit the audience right at their heart.

Little can be said to describe the beauty with which this production has been crafted. Directed by the Belgian Ivo Van Hove, best known as the artistic director of __Toneelgroep Amsterdam__, the display is simple and polished. A single doorway is placed in the centre of the grey background with the audience surrounding the action on three sides. The stage is blank with a continuous glass bench marking its perimeter. Known for his avant garde, experimental approach to theatre, Van Hove has focussed on the subtleties of each character. Mr Alfieri, a lawyer who narrates the story of Carbone is placed as an integral part of the production. Played by Michael Gould, Alfieri observes the action from the back of the stage, the whites of his eyes highlighting a deep, unsettling pressure on the characters.

Particular credit should be given to Phoebe Fox who, in her role as Catherine, is both immediately lovable and remarkably powerful in confronting Strong. Delicate and kind, Katy’s influence on Eddie is heart-warming and makes this play’s tragic story all the more painful. The bleak grey costumes and mute lighting give the play a distinct aged feeling. With Alfieri’s narration, the production comes across as a snapshot from a black and white film with its distinct air of hindsight going far to crush the American Dream.

It is odd reviewing such an overwhelming production. I try to be somewhat objective, critical and still embed my opinion into the piece, but with this, that’s just not so easy. As much as I want to objectively analyse the piece, on this occasion, my emotional response far outweighs anything else I could say. With pulsing church music running in the background and a drum punctuating moments of heightened tension, it almost feels like it is Van Hove deciding when I should breath, when my heart should beat and when I should cry. As Alfieri tells us, “I could see every step coming, step after step, like a dark figure walking down a hall towards a certain door.”

So could the audience, but we were powerless. Like a well-planned ceremony, this production ripped up a man’s pride while we watched it rain blood from above.

_A View from the Bridge is on at Wyndham’s Theatre until April 11th._
