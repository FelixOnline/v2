Last week we freed the nipple and it was great.  The reaction was better than we even thought we could have hoped for. There wasn’t one. No one  complained, we received no angry letters, phone calls or emails. No one cared. Which proves our point. Nipples aren’t a big deal and though we still have a lot of work to do towards gender equality, maybe, just maybe we’re slowly getting there.

Ironically, this week, it seems there’s a heated conversation going on regarding consent training because Imperial has spent £5,000 on licensing an online consent training course. But while there are those who view it as a gross misallocation of resources, I’m sure victims of sexual abuse will disagree. Especially considering we’ve had two testimonials of sexual abuse in the paper this year already.

The conversation on gender equality is constantly expanding. Who knows – maybe next week we’ll have another female world leader? Or maybe the next US President will resemble an overcooked baked bean with a Pomeranian glued on its head. We’ll know for sure after Tuesday (probably).

For now, we’ve tried to provide some content that might clue you in on the US presidential election race.  Admittedly there’s not much, because the whole shebang is a mind-boggling travesty and with 2016 already being the turd that it is, we just didn’t want to push anyone over the edge.

Besides, what with the High Court coming out today saying Theresa May will have to ask parliament before activating article 50, if we’re really lucky, we’ll have our own travesty of a general election to worry about. Wooh!

But let’s not dwell on that. For now, let’s focus on the US, so read on and don’t forget to tune in next week for the aftermath.
