This will be the eighteenth [T in the Park](http://www.tinthepark.com/content/) taking place on the second weekend of July in the region of Kinross-shire, Scotland. Contrary to what the name may imply this is not your average tea party, or perhaps better said it’s nothing of the sort! Named after its main sponsor, the brewing company Tennents, T in the Park is a festival known to offer a huge variety of first class music and this year is no exception. 2011’s line-up includes big names such as Coldplay, Arctic Monkeys and Foo Fighters whose performance records promise not to disappoint. While The Killers have made several appearances at T over the years, Brandon Flowers returns on his own this time around having released a solo album last year. Beyoncé and MCR are sure to get the crowd pumped and the list goes on with nu-folk favourites such as Noah and the Whale and the successful Jimmy Eats World.

Originally a two-day festival, T in the Park has evolved into a major music experience spanning a total of seven main stages over a three day weekend. Previous years have seen performances by the Kings of Leon, Moby, Muse and The Chemical Brothers among others. A large camping area is completed with an array of various stalls and shops to cater for all tastes and fancies. Three days of top notch bands and artists not enough? Seek some thrills in an expansive funfair complete with a big wheel or take a gander into this year’s Ceilidh tent for some Gaelic fun. In addition, T often shows host to a comedy tent and silent disco as well.

Festivities will carry on into the wee hours of the morning with house legends such as Deadmau5, Swedish House Mafia and Scotland’s own Calvin Harris on deck. Prefer some drum and bass? Pendulum alongside Chase and Status will be there to provide the heaviest of bass. Special treats such as City and Colour, the italian electronic and dance music project Bloody BeetrootsDeath Crew 77 and many more will make this year’s festival one to remember.

Tickets for the festival start at £185 for full weekend camping, where for an additional tenner you can arrive earlier and start the party on the Thursday! A variety of single or two day passes are also available, in addition to lockers and campervan tickets. Note that parking tickets must be bought in advance.
