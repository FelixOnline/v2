Style. It’s different to fashion. Fashion suggests something fleeting, with trends that slip by like wind. Style, in contrast, is much more constant. It evokes a timeless ideal of chic-ness, a trend that will never go out of style; in other words, a classic.

This week’s issue is devoted to Style, and is the first of our ‘Themed Issues’ which will be running throughout this term. We start off with a look at Debbie Harry, who epitomises style in a new exhibition of photos at __Somerset House__. We then move swiftly on to __The Photographer’s Gallery__, whose hallowed halls play host to two fashion photographers from opposing ends of the century: __Edward Steichen__, the high priest of modernist fashion, and __Viviene Sassen__, whose confrontational photos challenge traditional ideas of photography.

Fashion is the next target in our sights, as we explore the links between clothing and power at the __Design Museum__’s latest show, and analyse the long-standing relationship between art and fashion.

Of course, the theme is not the be all and end all. We also have a number of other reviews of what is going on in London. If you’re into art, check out Kieran’s review of the __Sigmar Polke__, or Elizaveta’s analysis of __Egon Schiele__’s nudes. If theatre is more your thing, then you can choose from Max’s royal review of __Charles III__, Jingjie’s take on ‘Tis Pity She’s A Whore, or or Mario’s short and sweet piece on __The Cherry Orchard__.

Here’s to a stylish week...
