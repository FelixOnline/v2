It’s been a big year for I.C. Wing Chun. We’ve joined the UK Wing Chun Kung Fu Association (UKWCKFA), a leading association for Wing Chun with links across the country and the world. Imperial students now have the opportunity to train with Sifus from Britain’s leading VTTA approved association; headed by Sifu James Sinclair, who has impressive experience.
Our new Sifu, Nick Martin, will be joining on Feb 7. He is currently giving Wing Chun seminars across India. We’re extremely excited as a club for the new talent and energy Sifu Nick will bring. We’d like to welcome any new members to come down and join us for a free taster session on Feb 7; his very first session with I.C. Wing Chun. This will run from 6pm-8pm in Activity Space 2 in the Union Building.
As well as high class training, joining the UKWCKFA also means our members can use associated clubs across the country. This means training can continue throughout the holidays.
We strongly believe in giving our members the best training available, and fostering a fun and friendly environment as a whole. One of our most recent achievements has been taking our members to perform in the Victoria and Albert Museum along with the CSSA for Chinese New Year Celebrations. We want to keep creating fantastic opportunities like this to improve skill, confidence, and control.
Come down and check us out! You can contact us via wingchun@ic.ac.uk or search I.C. Wing Chun Union on Facebook. Everybody is welcome, whether you’ve done martial arts before or if this is your first time. We look forward to seeing you!
