FELIX has learnt that Sigma, the DJ duo who were due to play the ICU Summer Ball, have cancelled and will be replaced by DJ Fresh. Despite the fact that a contract had already been signed, Sigma told the union last week that they would not be playing the Summer Ball on the 18th of June, presumably because they’ve had a better offer.

The union announced the headliner via a video of past summer balls on Thursday the 28th of April. Last week, however, sources close to FELIX learnt that the band had pulled out. This morning, the union managed to secure DJ Fresh instead.

Tickets are already on sale, and students have been buying them at £37.50 a pop under the impression that Sigma was playing for two weeks now. The price will be hiked to £42.50 on the 20th of May.

According to Sigma’s Songkick and Seetickets pages, the band haven’t ditched us for any festivals. They’re playing both the Isle of Wight festival and The Parklife weekender in Manchester the weekend before the Summer Ball, but then they have a gap before they play Ibiza rocks on the 24th of June.

Sigma have had two number ones: ‘Nobody to love’ in 2014, and ‘Changing’ with Paloma Faith in the same year. The duo met at Leeds University before signing to DJ Fresh’s record label in London.

DJ Fresh is most famous for his number ones, ‘Louder’ and ‘Hot Right Now’ with Rita Ora, released in 2011 and 2012 respectively.

These days, DJ Fresh’s tour schedule is decidedly less packed. He played Aberystwyth University’s Summer Ball on Sunday.

The Summer Ball is on the 18th of June.
