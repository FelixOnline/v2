Oh, errors of judgement. How I know you well! Last term, just as we were heading off for Christmas, I wrote, in a throwaway comment that I’d now like to dispose of properly, that the Black Keys’ latest album El Camino is a ‘[dud](http://felixonline.co.uk/music/1931/kadhims-totally-hot-album-of-the-week-10/)’. Well, it is time to make amends. Using all the powers of apology that [I acquired as Felix Editor last year](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/1242/union-president-maggie-dallman-misinformed-college-council/), let me now say, “I was wrong”.

This change-of-heart occurred on the road from Alexandra Palace last week. We all know how difficult it is to admit changes of musical taste – God, forbid I should ever start enjoying __Lana Del Rey__ – so do not view this Damascene conversion lightly. I was returning from the __Black Keys__ gig [see Simon Hunter's review [here](http://felixonline.co.uk/music/2198/blacks-keys-rock-a-heart-at-the-ally-pally-/)] at the aforementioned venue, through a blizzard of snow that sadly didn’t stay until the morning, when I realised my coolness towards _El Camino [[Spotify link](http://open.spotify.com/album/5DLhV9yOvZ7IxVmljMXtNm)]_ was misplaced.

My first taste of the __Black Keys__ came from the [superb mash-up](http://mashville.bandcamp.com/album/the-brothers-of-chico-dusty) of their album _Brother_ with __Big Boi’s__ debut, _Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty_. It has jazz, style, and an unquantifiable something that gets you moving in your chair. When I finally listened to the original, _Brother_, I found myself standing from my chair, leaping on the table, and dancing like I imagine I would if my life was a movie...

I should say that all of this happened about a year after everyone else had listened to _Brother_. “Hey man, have you heard this sweet-ass album?” – “Yeah, Kadhim, like a year ago; why are we still friends?” But then, a new album appeared on the horizon. I could love the __Black Keys__ and get down and jive, at the same time as everyone else. Holy fucking hallelujah! The first single, ‘Lonely Boy’, seemed to live up to my dreams – a ragged chainsaw guitar riff and [an impeccably cool music video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_426RiwST8).

But when the album came out, I felt let down. It wasn’t the hell-raising party I had expected. There was a change of tone; it was less bombastic and more introspective. Instead of screaming, “MY NEXT GIRL [bumb bumb bumb] WILL BE NOTHING LIKE MY EX-GIRL!” here they were singing woefully, “Operayyytor please, put me back on the line … … told my girl I’d be back, Operayyytor please, this is wrecking my mind.”

It was only when I saw them live that I began to appreciate _El Camino’s_ softer touch (and upsettingly realised that much of its energy had been stripped out by my laptop’s tinny speakers). _Brother_ and _El Camino_ felt much less in opposition and more like a complementary yin and yang.

_If you feel the need to point out that @[theblackkeys](http://twitter.com/theblackkeys) have five other albums, then tweet, “you don’t know shit!”, [@kadhimshubber](http://twitter.com/kadhimshubber). Otherwise, tweet [@ImperialLibrary](http://twitter.com/imperiallibrary) complaining about their [Inceptrance](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150671468180281&set=o.293499337371467&type=3&theater)._
