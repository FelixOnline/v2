After months of delay Campus services have finally given halls residents a comprehensive guide to the cleaning provisions provided in halls. The division has recently sent students a booklet containing information about the services the cleaners will provide in different areas of the building, along with a list of equippment available for students to use. The guide itself also provides tips on how to keep bedrooms clean.
Campus Services have also released schedules pinpointing the exact date each room will be cleaned during the term, a list of the locations of vacuum cleaners in halls.
Essentials has also introduced bundles for cleaning materials, separated into a bathroom bundle and a kitchen bundle. For more informaiton, go to:
