The 2s continued their perfect streak with yet another win, this time at Fortress Harlington against Canterbury Christ Church. With the 1s on a rest week, the team had a big, loud crowd to back them up, and did not disappoint. The Imperial pack was unstoppable, winning every scrum, making it easy work for power centre Giustinuainaiai (spelling confirmation pending) to smash through the try line, topping it all off with a celebratory “dab”. After the stalemate was broken, Imperial cruised on through to an easy win, with a very cheeky hat-trick from fake fresher (but real lobster) Tuleu, two wonderful break-away tries by Rob ‘I didn’t think he was that fast’ Lawrence, and a good solo effort off the scrum by fresher Dowkes. Apparently the man of the match, Will ‘He’s an alright captain’ Bolton also scored a try, but got a knock on the head so I wouldn’t take his word for it. Canterbury did score a try, but my memory is pretty hazy on the details. End score 55-5.
