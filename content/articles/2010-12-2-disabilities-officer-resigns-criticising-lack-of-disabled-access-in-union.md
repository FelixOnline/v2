     I wish Nicola Hopkins had not resigned so she could help me.I have Aspergers Syndrome and distrust the Disabilities Services and my department head and few others who have mistreated me since I started.They made me feel bad about myself.I worked very hard to get accepted by Imperial College having gone through major knee surgeries and now after 2 years I feel bad being there.Everyone finds me strange and I have no friends.Please tell others about Aspergers so they understand people like me cannot help the way we are. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>,I'm sorry to hear this. I too felt very mistreated by the College's disability services when I approached them for help. They treated me like it was my fault. So I've decided to get help privately.

The Union’s commitment to disabled students was called into question last week as the Union Disabilities Officer resigned saying that the Union “should be leading the way in accessibility for students, not lagging behind the rest of the university”.

In a letter published in Felix Nicola Hopkins described the difficulties she faced whilst in her position, especially as the role is voluntary and part-time. Hopkins explained that she had “raised the issue of the lack of disabled access to the new Union venues and that the disabled lift in the Union Building is faulty and therefore unusable for disabled students. Neither issues has been resolved to date (8 weeks later)”. Among other problems Hopkins felt the lack of urgency was disappointing since the Imperial’s Disability Equality Scheme states that all “refurbishments have considered accessibility as a major priority”. With all this in hand Hopkins decided to step down.

In response to Hopkins’ resignation, Deputy President (Welfare) Charlotte Ivison said she was “very sorry to see Nicola leave” but said that some of the issues raised by Hopkins are being resolved. The lifts in the Union Building will be “fixed as soon as possible” and there are plans to have push button doors to each of the bars. However the issue of a drop bar (a lowered bar to allow wheelchair users to be directly served at the bar) was considered unfeasible “in terms of cost and inconvenience when considering the number of students it will benefit.” Although the Union did say, “To minimise the problem caused by not having a drop bar, all the bars have staff on hand to offer an assisted service to any students who may need it.”

Nicola Hopkins responded positively saying, “I am pleased to hear that the Union has taken on board my suggestions and look forward to seeing them put in place soon.”

If you feel the Union or College could do more or have any suggestions for improvements, email dpwelfare@imperial.ac.uk for the Union and disabilities@imperial.ac.uk for College.
