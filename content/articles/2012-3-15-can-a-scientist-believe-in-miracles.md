     If a scientist were to allow the existence of supernatural events then why bother trying to explain nature when it may have been a conjuring trick anyway? How is a cosmologist to tackle the question "What if the universe were simply created with the appearance of being 13.7 billion years old but is in fact a few thousand?" ? It is clear that a scientist must assume that supernatural events do not occur otherwise the whole scientific endeavour becomes nearly pointless. Of course an intellectually lazy way out would be to pick cherry pick miracles which don't happen to grossly step on the toes of modern science as the above example. <br> <br>'That no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous, than the fact, which it endeavours to establish...' ... Clearly the delusion and deception of a few is more reasonable than allowing the occasional resurrection? <br> <br>,I'm not sure exactly what you mean by 'miracle', but it is either: <br> <br>(1

Most people define a miracle as a supernatural event, inexplicable by the laws of science and nature. So is it reasonable for a modern, rational, Imperial scientist to believe in miracles?

Last week I spent an afternoon wandering around the Blackett lab, asking fellow Physics undergraduates for their opinion on this. Many simply hadn’t considered the question, and freely admitted they didn’t have any thoughts on the matter. Others refused to answer, perhaps nervous of this odd, religious second year interrupting their conversations. However, a few had stronger opinions. One student stated that miracles were impossible, another that a belief in miracles and a belief in physical laws are incompatible. Yet another explained that his belief in miracles and his scientific studies were two separate areas that didn’t necessarily contradict one another.

Let’s conduct a little thought experiment. A first year medic bursts from the SAF claiming that a supernatural event has taken place. A cadaver, just about to be dissected, suddenly opened its eyes, sat up and asked for a glass of water. As a rational Imperial scientist, you’re naturally sceptical, and your friend sitting with you looks incredulous. Your friend immediately exclaims “That’s complete balderdash!” and continues eating. But you’re not so quick to dismiss the claim. You question the medic a little further: “Are you certain of what you saw? Have you slept much lately? Was anyone else present?” The story still checks out, and you decide to go and examine the evidence for yourself. You enter the SAF and immediately see a group of medics laughing uproariously. It turns out to have been an elaborate RAG Week prank.
> My entire faith hangs on the miracle of Jesus Christ, having been dead for three days, rising from the dead
But who was the better scientist: you or your friend? Despite the fact that your friend was correct, how was he so certain? I would like to suggest that it is unscientific to dismiss miracles without first investigating the evidence, even if the claim is outrageous. Because we all study science it can be easy to forget that scientific laws are not infallible. They are simply expectations based on consistent observation and experience.

Now, as a Christian I certainly believe in miracles. Christianity makes no sense if miracles aren’t possible. My entire faith hangs on the miracle of Jesus Christ, having been dead for three days, rising from the dead. Of course, you’d initially think that was impossible. So did all those who claim to have seen Jesus alive after his death. In the biographies of Jesus’s life, we read of how his own friends took some convincing before they really believed it was him, and not a ghost or some trick of the mind. Jesus talked to them, touched them, and ate with them. Only then did they begin to believe.

Interestingly, the Bible doesn’t seem to make much distinction between supernatural and everyday events. It explains how in God “all things hold together” – that is, matter would cease to exist if God were to stop sustaining it. From this perspective, our very existence is the real miracle. Any so-called ‘supernatural events’ might be unusual, but are just as miraculous as everything else.

There is one other, huge miracle in the Bible. According to Jesus, the most important things in life are to love God with all your heart, soul, strength and mind, and to love your neighbour as you love yourself. I can’t answer for everyone, but I know that I, for one, have not met these criteria. I’m a long, long way off. But by his death and resurrection Jesus has made it possible for me to have the right relationship with God, despite all my shortcomings. The miracle is that anyone who has faith in this, no matter who you are or what you’ve done, can look forward to an eternity in paradise.

_Perhaps what you’ve read has been intriguing, provoking or just plain offensive! I’d love you to bring your questions or objections to a series of events investigating the resurrection of Jesus next week at Imperial. It’s advertised under “Impossible, Improbable, Irrelevant?” To find out more check out [www.impossible2012.org](http://www.impossible2012.org). I hope to see you there!_
