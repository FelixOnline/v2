As the imaginatively named title of this column would suggest, each week I hope to bring you a top notch hip-hop tune. This week’s song comes courtesy of [__Schoolboy Q__](http://www.myspace.com/schoolboyq)’s recently released album _Habits and Contradictions_. The song samples a live Lissie cover of the __Kid Cudi__ track ‘The Pursuit of Happiness’ for the chorus and also features critic’s favourite __A$AP Rocky__. In an album with a general tone of moody introspective aggression, ‘Hands on the Wheel’ is a relatively upbeat affair with tight production courtesy of __Best Kept Secret__.

The song is one of the most accessible on the album and is a good introduction to the versatility of Schoolboy Q’s rapping. The album also contains features from the other members of the __Black Hippy Crew__ who are helping to reinvent West Coast rap. If you’re a fan of the old-school hardcore hip-hop reminiscent of __N.W.A.__ I would recommend checking out the album.
