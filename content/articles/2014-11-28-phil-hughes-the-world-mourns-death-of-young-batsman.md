8th March 2009, Kingsmead, Durban. An Australian batsman is entertaining the crowd with a superb hundred. It was his second of the game, and meant that he, at the age of 20, became the youngest man to score two hundreds in a Test Match. It was just his second test match. This week, we mourn his passing.
Phillip Hughes, who would have turned 26 on Sunday, was largely considered one of Australia’s most talented batsmen when he started out for New South Wales at the age of 18. He became the youngest batsman to score a century in the Sheffield Shield Final when he scored 116 against Victoria to lead his side to victory. It was his maiden First Class century.

Hughes died from vertebral artery dissection, an injury that has only ever been recorded a hundred times. And only once due to a cricket ball. The injury was described by doctors as “extremely rare and a freak injury”.

He leaves behind his mother, father, brother and sister.
 And a grieving cricket world.
