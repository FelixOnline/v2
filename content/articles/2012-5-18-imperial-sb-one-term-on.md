A whole term has now passed with Imperial having its very own Skateboard/BMX society so here are all the gory details as to what’s been going on. Last term, we managed to skate/BMX a good chunk of the skateparks that London has to offer. These included concrete classics such as Meanwhile and Stockwell as well as new offerings such as Victoria and Clapham Common.

Victoria skatepark (see crazy upside-down BMX photo) was really a lot of fun to ride. Although it suffers from a severe infestation of little kids at peak times, it’s a brilliant experience once you’re able to hit all the lines. The huge cradle (London’s first) is a great addition if you can pluck up the courage to ride it – same goes for the absolutely ridiculous deep-end of the bowl (upwards of 10ft). With the Olympics just around the corner, a skatepark like this is exactly what the East End needs. It definitely has a lot of support.

Also new in London last term – Clapham Common skatepark. This skatepark has had a complete overhaul recently and it’s definitely for the better. This isn’t your typical skatepark though. With funky new additions like the pole jam and the huge concrete bump, it’s a pretty unique ride. Sure, it still has a mini-ramp if you want it, but the layout of the whole park is really fun to try and string into a line. Apart from the dubious decision to leave half the surface as tarmac and the lack of flood lights, Clapham Common is always a good skate. Note, however, the standard here is high. Whether you find that off-putting or inspiring is up to you.

Now with exam season upon us, it’s easy to let skating peter out into a distant memory. However, I can only urge you to try and keep it up. Spring offers (or should be offering...) perfect weather for skating. Not too hot, not too cold and with the prospect of a long vacation just around the corner. So if ever feel like skating/BMXing post on our Facebook group ‘[SB Imperial](http://www.facebook.com/groups/194019090616492/)’ and check out our new blog at [imperialsb.tumblr.com](http://imperialsb.tumblr.com). Don’t forget to keep riding.
