An investigation was launched after astaff member thought a kestral may have been either shot (yes, shot, as in by a gun) or had died after colliding with Sherfield.

After the investigation, it turned out that nobody had been doing some hunting of kestrals on campus, and that the bird was actually a Woodcock that was attacked by another bird, possibly a Peregrine Falcon.

A post mortem by a College vet also, unsurprisingly, found no evidence that someone had “popped a cap in the Woodcock’s ass, yo”.
