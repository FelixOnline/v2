Those who paid attention in GCSE History will remember what a fantastic time 1920s America was: cue [Rudolph Valentino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_Valentino), the first heartthrob of Hollywood’s silent films; thriving underground speakeasies under the Prohibition act and the infamous Valentine Day’s Massacre of Al Capone. Just don’t mention the Depression that followed...

So 80 years after the booze ban was lifted, why on earth am I talking about Prohibition? The illegal parties it spawned serving moonshine and the like has inspired an increasingly popular event, titled ‘[Prohibition](http://www.prohibition1920s.com/)’, no less.

Rooting from the humble Bourne & Hollingsworth bar in Fitzrovia which catered to 80 people, the impressive Bloomsbury Ballroom is quite a step up after four incredibly successful events.

Mark Holdstock, the mastermind behind the concept, makes you sip liquor out of teacups, hides bottles among the plants and even organizes a mock raid – so fear not if you think your squeaky clean criminal record is about to be tainted. Complete with gambling tables and flappers dancing the Charleston, Prohibition offers an edge to the standard RnB nights saturating the clubbing scene. The only requirement for punters is to turn up with attire reflective of the ‘Roaring Twenties’, whether that be flapper dresses or moustaches and pinstripe waistcoats.

Saturday 6th November 2010, doors open from 8pm at the Bloomsbury Ballroom WC1B 4DA. Tickets cost £15 from [www.prohibition1920s.com](http://www.prohibition1920s.com) and are selling out fast!
