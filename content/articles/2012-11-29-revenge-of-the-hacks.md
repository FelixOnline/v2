     A low quality, scattergun approach to hacking just to get big names to appear on a list. These kinds of data dumps can be produced automatically by pointing a SQL Injection tool at a domain name, where it will systematically attack every point of user input looking for vulnerabilities. <br> <br>They've obviously not even checked for the value of some of the data extracted, as the University of Bristol's "hacked" data dump shows a very uninteresting (and small) set of species diversity data. <br> <br>Hardly a groundbreaking attack.

This may be old news to some, but at the start of term, the databases of several universities worldwide were hacked. Called “Project WestWind” according to [the manifesto of “Team Ghost Shell”](http://pastebin.com/AQWhu8Ek), the system intrusions were a protest about changes in modern education, both in terms of rising tuition fees. They also describe a change in the usefulness of higher education, stating “…we have ventured from learning valuable skills that would normally help us be prepared in life, to just, simply memorizing large chunks of text in exchange for good grades”, something I’m sure students may identify with.

After the statement of their cause, Team Ghost Shell provide a list of links to the compromised databases, including universities such as Harvard, John Hopkins, and Imperial. Using the only working link for Imperial takes you to a page filled with data from the RCC Underwater club, containing some names, logins and email addresses of members and administrators. Why they picked on RCC Underwater is unknown, but this does highlight the need for a stronger focus on information security as we increase our daily reliance on technology.
