"I have so much work! I hate Imperial!" Heard this before? Mmm... I thought so - there is a lot of this Imperial hate around. The same university that everyone has chosen to attend also appears to be the root of all of their misfortunes and unhappiness.

This viewpoint is flawed and unhealthy in a number of ways. The most obvious comment to make is that university is not in any way compulsory, and being in one of the worldís best is a fantastic opportunity. I don't see how anyone could accept a place at a university in which they donít want to be. I mean the choice was always yours.



Imperial is not something to hate, because in essence it is not a thing; it is an institution within which people can further their knowledge of science, engineering and medicine. I may be being a bit pompous here, but the point is that there is nothing to hate. I don't really see Imperial as a big monster trying to force anyone to join or to do anything actually. If you don't want to work you can choose not too. The place should not be demonised, as it is the people themselves that make it what it is.



Fundamentally it must not be the centre of the studentís universe. We live in London after all. Donít you think a lot of people would find themselves quite content studying in one of the world's ten best universities whilst living in central London?



This brings me to my final point, a place to study at Imperial College is worth a lot. Iím not talking about money, even though it IS very expensive. For every student here there is probably at least one other that has been left to find somewhere else to study. So if you donít want to be here, let someone who does take your place.



No one likes working as such but that doesnít excuse hating, or pretending to hate, a place where weíve all chosen to be.
