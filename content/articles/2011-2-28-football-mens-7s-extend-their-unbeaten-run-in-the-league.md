     Hi Charles,I can see your thinking. We aim to have BuildorPro run in FF, IE 7+, Safari and Chrome and the brewsor that your using the app in will render whatever CSS/HTML it understands first (for the new CSS3 rules too) but you will be able to edit all code directly through the HTML/CSS view.For IE 6, you can preview your changes and load them in that brewsor for checking as frequently as you like but we haven't done any serious testing in terms of runing the app in IE6.Thanks for your interest in Buildor,James

Imperial 7s travelled to Chislehurst to play St Bart's 4s away on a pitch that was, for lack of a better word, soupy.

The game started on a positive note for the 7s, with some high tempo passing and good runs leaving St Bart's chasing shadows. A deft through-ball from speedy right-winger James was met by his left-winger Alan, who avoided their goalkeeper's awful attempt at an interception to calmly turn and slot in the resulting free ball. Some complacency crept in, with St Bart's dominating possession and finally getting an equalizer when a feeble shot somehow beat our keeper.

Imperial went on the attack again with some brilliant play by midfield pair Milo and Dan. Some ridiculous heading from Chris Beardsell from a corner allowed captain Josh to calmly header past the last defender from six yards out. The first half finished 2-1.

The second half kicked off with IC keeping the pressure up with long balls splitting their defence. It was only a matter of time before IC scored again, which proved to be true when a corner was headed on by left-back Haran, allowing Alan to control the ball and score his second. A goal-line clearance from Beardsell ensured the win for IC.

The game finished 3-1 with Man of the Match going to Kiran, whose slick control and mazy dribbles caused St Bart's continuous hassle.
