1 in 5 women aged 16 - 59 has experienced some form of sexual violence since the age of 16.

It’s finally gaining attention in the news, but what can we, as students, do to make a difference? Join IC FemSoc and share your ideas, whether it’s ways of raising awareness, changing policy, or practical solutions to make people feel safer. Join a group of like-minded people and join forces to work on ideas to make a difference.

FemSoc has run several events this year, including an introduction to feminism, a TED-talk event and, our first collaboration of the year, a discussion with the new Kinky Klub on feminism and kink. We’re a relentlessly sex-positive society, famous for handing out free condoms and dental dams at Freshers’ Fair and at our events. But talking about sexism is impossible without talking about sexual assault and violence, especially when its been so prevalent in the news. This is the first of several events planned by IC FemSoc to look at how we, as Imperial students, can make a tangible difference. Being the hotbed of innovation that it is, we’re sure Imperial is the perfect place to start coming-up with new and innovative ways to tackle sexual assault. So come along to 630 Blackett on 12th February at 6.00pm and join like-minded to come-up with ways to tackle this problem and help them become a reality.
