The [Union General Meeting](http://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/data/files/generalmeetingfinal-1085.pdf) was held last Wednesday to a baying crowd of approximately twenty interested individuals. It was unlikely to take incredible precedence in many a calendar across Imperial due to the stage of term. The low attendance (with 200 required to reach quorum) was undoubtedly a combination of timing – with many still remaining in the midst of exams and revision – a general lack of publicity, and for want of a better word, hype.

As difficult as it might be to build up the enthusiasm at three weeks notice for 200 students to argue it out over a range of issues, a significant number of students Felix took the time to question were unaware that the General Meeting was actually taking place on Wednesday.

This is not a huge surprise given the year-on-year apathy that exists not only at Imperial but at other universities across the United Kingdom. What it is, however, is a shame, as the propositions brought forward are wide-ranging and are likely to change the Union significantly if they come into action. The input from a wider range of students is likely to be invaluable.

The points raised are definitely worth your consideration. The Sabbatical Officer position of Deputy President (Finance & Services) has the potential to be removed, with the officers’ current more administrative-focused tasks being assigned to permanent staff and allowing the new emergent role the task of overseeing .

Sabbatical Officers will potentially have the opportunity to hold positions on the Union’s Trustee Board, which is the sovereign and governing body of the Union. It acts as the Union’s most powerful committee and is responsible for its ultimate objectives and finances. It has been proposed that the addition of Sabbatical Officers will reduce the President’s overall power, but what is your view on this?

You may see some aspects of the introduction of a Postgraduate Sabbatical, for example, as necessary or unnecessary accordingly.

The points of discussion at the Union General Meeting will now move to Union Council on Monday 11 June. If you have any opinion at all on the issues at hand, it is recommended that you raise any such opinion here, before the propositions are either passed or rejected. The meeting is open to any student, and you have the potential at this meeting to make the difference in the future of the Union.
