> > Loud cries of protest could be heard from the next room
After some technical difficulties around kick off, ICTV and Imperial College London’s evening of candidate-grilling began.

Ex-Union President, Paul Beaumont, played Jeremy Paxman on the night. Most would agree his style was kind, despite asking one candidate who’d claimed sabbs were “CV padders” whether this included the host. The Youtube comment stream yelped excitedly throughout the night, with current sabbs, students from UCL and notable BNOCS all  commenting.

A record number of candidates, including nine for President and six for Deputy President (Welfare) turned up on the night.

A notoriously nerve-wracking experience, some thrived in the limelight. 30-second pitches were forgotten, promotional clothing was worn and hard hitting questions were asked, such as: “How do you spell Rhododendron?”

A pundit panel included ex-sabbs who chatted about the candidates in the radio studio inbetween hard-hitting interviews in the media basement’s shared studio.

Some of the basement’s sound issues were made obvious when one of the FELIX Editor candidates said if forced to get rid of a section he would axe the horoscopes, after which loud cries of protest could be heard from the next room.
