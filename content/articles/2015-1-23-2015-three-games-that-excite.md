Star Wars Battlefront

My first ever shooter was _Star Wars Battlefront 2 _for the ps2. Trust me when I tell you that I wasted an extraordinary amount of my school years playing this game. It was a pretty epic game. However, it was released back in 2005, ten years ago. Therefore the announcements that the next _Battlefront_ is coming this year have filled me with excitement as well as trepidation. Excitement, because obviously I get to see a new version of a game I hold dearly and trepidation because this new version is going to be produced by EA.

The teaser trailer really did a lot to hype the game, and I just hope that this won’t be a re-skin of_ Battlefield 4_. This game is expected on all platforms and will be released with the new _Star Wars_ film in late 2015.

Just Cause 3

The grappling hook, parachute and crazy physics have all entered gaming culture. Now it seems we will get to use them once again in the newest _Just Cause,_ in addition to a wingsuit. While the game mechanics will remain mostly the same, the location and story are completely new. The new map is on par in terms of size with that of _JC2_, but you now have the ability to explore subterranean caves. Furthermore, its located in the Mediterranean and you return as Rico to battle against the dictator General Di Ravello.

Given the stance that there will be no microtransactions in this game, I have hope that this game will deliver on all its promise. This game will be available on all platforms with no exact release date at the moment.

Zelda Wii U

_Legend of Zelda_ is that one franchise that everyone has heard of, and anyone who calls themselves a gamer has played at least one of the entries of this juggernaut. Therefore a lot is riding on _Zelda Wii U_ (the official title is still unknown). The hype training has just been going on and on, and ever since it was known that it would be open world, been gathering speed. The description that it looks like the _Skyrim_ version of _Zelda_ does seem to have some truth, and all the better.

Hopefully this game will be able to fully utilise the hardware that the Wii U has to offer and incorporate the second screen in a meaningful way.

This game will be only available on Wii U (kind of obvious since it’s Nintendo), however a more specific date is not known.
