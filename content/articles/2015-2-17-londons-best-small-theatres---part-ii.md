## ## __Battersea Arts Centre__
There’s something wrong with the __Battersea Arts Centre__. Although the management would have you believe its decrepit shell is from a beautiful Grade II listed former town hall, its insides leave a lot to be desired. However, what it lacks in a permanent purpose built modern stage, is made up for by the incredible versatility of the spaces so many other venues could only dream of. The BAC’s direction and creative edge is at the forefront of British theatre. Under the leadership of David Jubb, the theatre emphasises the spirit of radicalism and has supported a number of key contemporary artists in recent years, making it where to go to for the best in experimental theatre.

Next: _Missing_, by the Gecko Company__

4th - 21st March

Although it’s not really my sort of thing, the Gecko company are the people to see for physical dance theatre. A journey into the depths of the human psyche, Missing will likely be just as nuts as what you’d usually expect from the BAC.
## ## __The Orange Tree__
__The Orange Tree__’s auditorium is set in the round. Although some shows suffer as a result, the intimacy of a set surrounded by the audience can do wonders for a show. With no audience member more than a few metres from the action, the subtlety and tone of the actor’s performances can have nuances often invisible. Is that always a good thing? Probably not, but it’s a perspective you won’t see everywhere else. With Paul Miller as the new artistic director, 2015 will likely see a change in focus after 42 years with Sam Walters at the helm. Having worked on numerous productions at renowned theatres, Miller’s tenure at Sheffield’s __Crucible__ saw widespread critical acclaim which will likely continue at __Orange Tree__, heightening its reputation to the very top of the London theatre scene.

Next: _Play Mas _

11th March - 11th April

Winning best play at the __Royal Court__ in 1974, this is the first major revival of Mustapha Matura’s _Play Mas_. Set in the Port of Spain in the 1950’s, Matura’s wickedly funny script and sharp, entertaining dialogue make this my must-see show for March.
## ## __The Park Theatre__
As one of London’s newest theatres, __Park Theatre__ opened its doors to widespread critical acclaim in May 2013, and since then has gone from strength to strength. Built from the shell of an old office block, the theatre’s two purpose-built spaces make Park one of the most welcoming and versatile venues in North London. With the backing of a number of major players in the industry, Park is in a unique position: It is highly regarded in the theatre community and many talk of it as being one of the best new theatres in London, but very few people have actually had a chance to get to know it. It’s new enough to be exciting but not so old that you already know what you’re getting. Take it from me, Park Theatre is certain to be one to watch over the next few years.

Next: _The Glass Protégé_

14th April - 9th May

Fresh from a 6 week run in Chicago, the show explores sexuality in 1949 Hollywood. Suppressed by taboos, actor Patrick Glass embarks on a scandalous affair which threatens his career. I warn you, there’ll be an awful lot of people getting naked in this show.
## ## __The Tricycle Theatre__
__The Tricycle Theatre__ is one of those venues that even non-theatre types hear about. Founded in the 1980’s on Kilburn High Road, and branding itself as a local venue with an international vision, the Tricycle is something of an oddity. From the outside, the bar and lounge have all the characteristics that you’d usually find in your run of the mill Odeon. But the true surprise is hidden away in the auditorium. With all the character of a top of the range circus and a regular audience to match, a spectacular red frame built from scaffolding forms the core of the seating area. Under Artistic Director Indhu Rubasingham, the Tricycle has built a reputation for its collaborative work nationally and internationally. Presenting six main productions a year with impeccable reviews across the board, the Tricycle might not take itself too seriously but the critics certainly do.

What to see next: Anything!

Seriously, if you really have nothing particular in mind, the Tricycle will almost always impress, regardless of the show.They have a number of pieces coming up over the next few months; for anyone interested, I would recommend heading over to their website and checking out what catches your fancy.
