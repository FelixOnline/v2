If you have ever strolled into Imperial Union on a [Jazz n’ Rock](http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/arts/jazzrock/) jam night, chances are you’ve been paralyzed by the sight of Inescapable Fate’s members tearing shit up with an admirable disregard for authorized decibel levels. [Inescapable Fate](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Inescapable-Fate/163518166995537) (IF) is Imperial’s foremost death metal band, and they will get the place they deserve in the limelight at [BONED, the second Felix Music Night](http://felixonline.co.uk/music/1314/boned-at-metric/), taking place at Metric on Saturday 11th June. We spoke to IF about their story and their performance.

__Who are you guys?__

IF: We’re a four-piece outfit: Kiran plays drums, Sean takes bass and vocals and Laurie and Will play guitar.

__How did IF get started?__

IF: Laurie and Sean first played together at a barbecue in 2006, covering ‘For Whom The Bell Tolls’. After that, Kiran joined them and Inescapable Fate was born. After seeing the band live at a Jazz and Rock event, during which performance several fans were nearly ejected from dB’s just for enjoying the show a bit too much, Will was invited to join the band, and the lineup was complete.

__How would you describe your music?__
 IF: It’s a good mix of thrash and death metal – we try to keep it catchy enough that everyone can enjoy it, whilst making sure that no-one can understand what Sean is saying.

__What are some of your influences?__

Laurie: There are too many to name, but the likes of Carcass, Cave In, Entombed, At The Gates and The Smiths are as good as any.

Sean: For my bass playing it’d be Steve Harris, Cliff Burton, Martin Mendez and Marcus Miller. For vocals, I’m a big fan of Tomas Lindberg, Mikael Akerfeldt, Jeff Walker and Randy Blythe.

Will: It’s tough to say, since I’ve listened to so much over the years. I like most things – anything from Judas Priest and Ozzy to Queen, or from Sting to Dream Theater or Opeth – it’s all good. Most recently however, I’ve really gotten into the “djent’’ movement: bands such as TesseracT and Monuments. It’s basically what happens when you mix groove with metal.

__Why do you believe there’s still a place for metal in modern music?__

IF: Metal is an extremely adaptable genre that combines aggression, melody and sheer volume with a cornucopia of different (and sometimes unexpected) influences to produce rich and varied music with few boundaries. And everyone loves a good mosh.

__What is the best live performance you’ve ever seen?__
 Laurie: Bolt Thrower at ULU in 2010. Classic West Midlands death metal. Bonus points for doing the “death’’ voice even between songs.

Sean: Iron Maiden at Twickenham Stadium in 2008.

Will: It’s not all about how fast you can play, but I do tend to enjoy the more technical gigs. I recently saw Symphony X play at Scala and it was phenomenal. Their talent is difficult to replicate on a good day, but they were playing above tempo and really working the crowd. It was fantastic.

__Why do you think people should come see you play?__
 IF: Because we’re passionate about our music and aim to put on a loud, energetic, and entertaining live show that can be enjoyed by metalheads and anyone with an open mind towards music.

Now all you have to do is come along and support Inescapable Fate as they rock the living crap out of BONED. Most importantly though, come and headbang your heart out.
