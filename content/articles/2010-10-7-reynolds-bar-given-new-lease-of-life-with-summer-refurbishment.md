While a lot of attention has been focussed on the refurbishment of Metric and FiveSixEight - as they will soon be called - renovations have also been taking place in the Reynolds Bar, the spiritual home of ICSM in Charing Cross Hospital.

Redecorating has been much gentler than at the Union, with work consisting mostly of a fresh colour scheme, as well as repairing or replacing damaged furniture.

In recent years, the Reynolds has been roaring on Bops and Sports Nights but has been mostly deserted during the day and on quieter evenings. In order to remain financially viable, it was felt that this worn, gloomy look should be replaced by a more inviting atmosphere where staff and students would want to socialise.

ICSMSU President, David Smith, stated that his hope was that the Reynolds feel, "more inviting, modern, and suitable for relaxing post-lecture or at lunchtime, yet still functioning well as a nightclub."

The Reynolds officially reopened last Friday, ahead of term, with the 'Summer of Love' Bop, hosted by the ICSM Summer Ball Committee.
