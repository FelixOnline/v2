     Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors, for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5% in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing).

Well damn, he did it. The meme is dead. 22 years after his first nomination, good old Leo has finally nabbed his long-awaited Oscar for his leading role in Alejandro Iñárritu’s epic _The Revenant_. Whilst this is good news, let’s not get carried away in our celebrations. Why not have a look at some of the other winners of the night. Hint: Sam Smith does not feature.

_Ennio Morricone – Best Original Score_

A lot of people on social media have been raving about this win, and I just thought I’d add to the celebrations. For those of you who don’t know, Morricone is an Italian composer of over 500 scores, most notably for his work on Sergio Leone’s _Dollars_ Trilogy. I think we can all be glad that recognition has finally come for his score of Quentin Tarantino’s phenomenal _The Hateful Eight_.

_Inside Out – Best Animated Feature_

Mark Kermode called this his favourite film of the year, and for once I am close to agreeing. This new instant-classic from Pixar in many ways revived a company some people were scared was losing its way. Following the release of their first critically panned film _Cars 2_, Pixar seemed to be going down a dangerous road. Let’s hope the inventive, emotive power, and downright charm of _Inside Out_ will usher in a second Pixar-renaissance

_Ex Machina – Best Visual Effects_

The one technical category _Mad Max: Fury Road_ couldn’t win, the VFX nominations were stuffed with big-budget blockbusters. But I am really pleased to see that the simple, unintrusive yet near-perfect realism of _Ex Machina_ won out – details over flashy stuff any day.
