Dear Friend: it would appear that we are approaching the end. We’ve had some laughs, we’ve shed some tears. I think overall we had a pretty damn good time, wouldn’t you say?

I’ve very much enjoyed being one of the Music Editors for Felix this year. It’s one of those things that got me through the tougher times of life at Imperial. Being a student at one of the UK’s leading institutions is rewarding more often than not, but let’s just say there’s a dark and demanding side too. And you don’t want that stuff to bring you down. This is why it is so important to have extracurricular funtimes to latch onto, balancing out the good and the bad vibes: the yin and the yang of the student struggle, if you will. Perhaps this sort of activity is even more important in a place like Imperial, where I am convinced people at times believe there is nothing more to the student than his/her subject matter. This makes me sad.

I remember Fresher’s Week like it was yesterday. Okay, not really. But anyway I remember arriving at Imperial and people guaranteeing that I would be bored of the Union by the end of the first term. The naysayers had a point: it was nice to get out of the Imperial bubble and explore all the wonders London has to offer, be it musical or otherwise. I’ve had the opportunity to see most of my favourite bands of all time during my time at Imperial (here’s to you __Mars Volta__, __Nine Inch Nails__, __Health__, __Dillinger Escape Plan__ and __Flight of the Conchords__ to name but a few of you fucking legends) leaving me with many fond memories of unforgettable performances, shared with my best friends. I’ve also discovered so much great new music just by staying open and receptive to all opportunities of seeing and hearing brilliant up-and-comers with bright futures ahead of them (I love you __Factory Floor__).

I guess I’ve always had – and needed – music. I’m grateful that I found so many other people who think the same way despite the pressures of Imperial. Even though we might not be renowned for our talent for Arts here at ol’ Gimperial, some of the most talented musicians I have met in my life walk amongst us nerds incognito. If you’ve ever seen Will Jones shred on the guitar or Aaron Berk punishing the drums, then you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about. [Jazz & Rock Soc](http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/arts/jazzrock/) is a haven for Imperial musicians, and I tip my tophat to the gents that run that beautifully-oiled machine. Long live J&R. I also want to take this opportunity to publicize that Nick Read is an all-around badass.

I am also forever indebted to the Sexiest Editor Alive (not an actual award, though it totally should be): Kadhim Motherhugging Shubber. Not only for letting me spread my dribble on these pages, tainting the holy institution that is Felix, but also for believing in my ridiculous plans. Seriously, I spent a lot of time at the Union complaining about the quality of the acts. And most of the time under the influence of beer and whiskey. So when I set out to throw together a “punk”, cheap-as-chips DIY music night at Imperial, only a madman would have actually backed my fantasies with cold hard cash. Luckily my good friend Kadhim is a poet, which is close enough to mad for me, and so my dream of a united Imperial music scene materialised not once – but twice.

Through these activities I met a whole new cast of awesome peeps from [Music Tech](http://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/clubs-and-societies/a-to-z/m/music-tech/). First and foremost, my homeboy Iñigo Martinez de Rituerto, who introduced me to a load of talented electronic maestros. David Trevelyan ([__Phrij__](http://soundcloud.com/phrij)), Will Berg ([__Niceberg__](http://felixonline.co.uk/music/1366/bloops-razzes-and-buzzes/)), Adam Chainz and the rest of y’all - you rock my world. Long after I’m done at Imperial I’ll still be looking for new material by these guys, along with soon-to-be BBC Sound of 2012 winners [__Monsk__](http://soundcloud.com/user3090840), [__Vetoes__](http://felixonline.co.uk/music/698/balls-out-rock-at-1902-/) and [__The Tin Can 44s__](http://felixonline.co.uk/music/834/tin-cans-talkin-blues/). I’m kidding of course, I would never wish that sort of horror upon them. I know that they will however move onto bigger and greater things.

As for the Union itself, looking back I now realize I may have been a bit harsh in my inebriated judgement: the [Stop That Urban Noise](https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=49430345722) nights were actually kind of awesome: great line-ups, (__Rusko__, __Chase & Status__) plagued by Imperial’s general apathy and poor turnouts. I applaud Malcolm Macpherson and Ravi Pall for this, as well as for some great Summer Ball performances - especially that insane Scratch Perverts set last year.

One last shout-out and then I’ll get out of your hair and become just another nameless face you might or might not remember ten years from now. Selective memory is funny like that. I want to thank the boys from __Kensington Gore__ (get low, bitches) and __Operation Midnight Complex__ (or A Badger Cadaver, Malarky, T Minus, and whatever we’re called next year): you guys are seriously bad mofos.

And so my job here is done. I’m pleased to hand over the music section to Stephen and Iñigo. They’re more than qualified for the role and I’m sure they’ll do an awesome job.

In retrospect, Imperial isn’t half as bad as people initially made it out to be. There’s good people, good parties and damn good music. If you have any interest in music (and I don’t trust anyone who says they don’t) then I urge you to get involved. As a performer, as a fan, as a Felix contributor; whatever floats your boat. Just keep on rocking, baby.
