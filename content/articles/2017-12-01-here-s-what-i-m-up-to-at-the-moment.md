As Ethics and Environment Officer, my job is to support and facilitate campaigns to make our university fairer, greener, and more sustainable. Below are some things I’ve been up to so far this term; if you think that there’s something I’ve missed, or that I could help you with, email me at icu-environmental@ic.ac.uk

•	Attending meetings with Deputy President (Finance and Services) and Union finance team to scrutinise the Union’s divestment plans, and ensure that the targets set out in last year’s divestment paper are met.
•	I’m in contact with the Union to help shape the Union’s divestment branding and publicity.
•	As part of Divest Imperial, I’m coordinating the hand-in of the petition calling on College to divest from fossil fuels.
