JuJu is an award winning bar located in the heart of glamorous Chelsea on King’s Road. It’s the ideal place for after work drinks or a pre-clubbing warm up. JuJu offers the finest cocktails in London, including the popular Pornstar Martini, mixed by undoubtedly brilliant bartenders. For the more “spendy” readers out there, you can also find an extensive list of wines and champagnes.

The amazing thing about JuJu is that it also includes a short (yet fulfilling) list of nibbles. To accompany our drinks we ordered vegetable spring rolls, chicken strips, duck rolls, basil king prawns, and several dips with pita bread. Well, you could say that it was more of a feast than a typical Friday night out. You would be wrong however: JuJu combines cocktails and food very harmonically, allowing us to report that it really has created a new “bar night” experience with reasonable prices.

So, how about organizing an end of academic year party in one of the reserved areas of JuJu, especially decorated to create the suitable atmosphere for an unforgettable night out with friends and colleagues? You shouldn’t visit JuJu if you’d prefer to have a quiet chat though; get ready to dance the night away and let the music bring you closer to your summer destination!

__JuJu__ 316 – 318 King’s Road, Chelsea, SW3 5UH. Open Monday to Saturday, Sunday for private bookings. For more information, visit [www.jujulondon.com](http://www.jujulondon.com) or call 0207 351 5998.
