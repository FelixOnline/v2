Hitting the screens almost exactly one year after its showing at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, “Mud” (McConaughey) is a wanted fugitive who puts far too much on the line in the name of love. Hiding out on a deserted island, he longs to be reunited with the love of his life Juniper (Witherspoon), although this ambitious plan of his is put in jeopardy as he is constantly hunted by shady characters who are clearly acting above the law.

But despite the title, the focus of the film isn’t entirely on Mud’s plans: director Jeff Nichols tells the story in the point of view of two young, naive boys (Sheridan, Lofland) who like an adventure: and they’re certainly in for the most unforgettable event of their lives.

Ellis (Sheridan) and Neckbone (Lofland) are best of friends who regularly go on river excursions riding around in their boat and bike. One day they stumble upon and befriend a mysterious man who has a lot to hide and needs protection.

Dealing with things that are far beyond their maturity level, the boys are initially hesitant about helping this shadowy figure, but knowing that it’s true love that gives Mud his drive, it’s Ellis who gets more stuck in, with his innocent views on how love, relationships and marriage work, whilst a sweet love life of his own seems to develop. Things at home are also rocky, further shattering his already fragile ideas on love. His parents are throwing around the much-dreaded D word, and this potential separation also hits him hard.

Set in parts of America you probably never knew existed, its rich, warm visuals embrace the long line of complex characters who are far more than they appear to be. Just what is Mud running from? Why are State Troopers hunting him down? Is Juniper really the beautiful sweetheart Mud thinks she is? Is what they share true love? Confusing for the audience, so imagine how baffling this must be for the kids in the middle of this.

The adult cast is excellent (McConaughey’s been piling on one fascinating performance after another over the recent years - after Magic Mike and Killer Joe, he is once again on fine form), but the real winning performances here are those of the child actors.

Sheridan, in his second film after Malick’s Tree of Life, shines displaying natural stoic bravery, and Lofland is equally brilliant in his screen debut.

It’s not as powerful or touching as Nichols’ previous directorial outing, the hauntingly beautiful Take Shelter, but here is a layered and rewarding coming-of-age story, somewhat with a similar feel to Stand By Me, made even more so thanks to Lofland’s striking resemblance to the young River Phoenix.
