__What is Wing Chun?__

Wing Chun is a close quarters hand to hand combat system developed in Southern China which has recently gained popularity due to the martial arts film Ip Man released in 2008 which is loosely based on the life of the late grand master Ip Man. Wing Chun has also been made famous by Bruce lee, who studied Wing Chun as a direct disciple of Ip Man, Lee took many of the principles and concepts behind the martial art into developing his own combat system Jeet Kune Do (JKD).

__Classes__

At Imperial College Wing Chun classes are run under the direction of Sifu Andrew Sofos and the Imperial College Wing Chun Society. Sifu Andrew has been running classes at Imperial for 26 years. During class students work towards a grading system set out by Sifu Andrews martial arts academy based in north London. Several of our students just completed their Level 1 grading over Christmas time, and a big congratulations are in order to all of them. Classes start with a quick but intense warm-up, training of the basic stance, punches and kicks before moving on to learn some basic practical self-defence techniques. More traditional aspects of the martial art are also taught including the first form Sil Nim Tau, and at later ranks, Chi Sao’s (Sticky hand exercises) which are used to train Wing Chun practitioners’ reactions and condition the arms. At the end of the class we finish off with footwork and some pad work to improve on coordination, concentration and confidence: helping you judge range, distance and power – above all, efficiency of movement. This also ties in with the strong emphasis on improving cardiovascular fitness.

__Seminars and socials__

Throughout the year Imperial College Wing Chun society also hosts several socials including movie nights, trips to china town and group drinks at the bar. This term we hope to have a joint social with some of the other martial arts clubs at Imperial College.
 Students also get the chance for discounts on seminars run by Sifu Andrew Sofos at his North London based martial arts academy. Seminars are 5-6 hour long intensive sessions run on one underlying theme, recently several students went on a ‘Street Survival’ seminar and found it very rewarding.

This term we have a special offer, your first two classes with us are free. There is no obligation to buy membership. Just turn up ready to train, and have fun.
