There will be an event in Level 2 of the Sherfield Building at 11:30am - 2:30pm on Tuesday 12 February in aid of Student Money Week. The aim of the Week is to raise awareness of student financial issues and offer help, advice and offer tips on how to save money and helping students budgeting day-to-day. The Student Financial Support Team and the Student Adviser from Imperial College Union will be available and will be available to offer a money “health check”.

The stand will be offering a “Guess the price” competition where students can win prizes by guessing the prices of groceries. There will also be prizes in a “Price is right” test, which will see what students know about accommodation costs.

There will also be the chance to win a £20 shopping voucher. To win, students must complete a short quiz, which will close at 14:30 on Tuesday 12 February and the winner will be announced on Wednesday 12 February.
