Having made a fantastic start to the season with two impressive wins, the fixture against King’s College London was eagerly anticipated, if approached with slight trepidation. In the previous three encounters last season, King’s had won convincingly on all occasions which led to their promotion in BUCS. However, they many of their starting line-up had graduated in the interim. In form, this fixture was set to be the first true test of how far Imperial has come since gaining momentum last season.

Things did not start well for IC. Taking to the pitch, Kings were already warmed up and firing on all cylinders. They kicked off the game and set up camp deep in the IC territory for much of the first half, kicking effectively to put themselves inside the 22.

The IC pack dominated in the scrum to win back some possession, with hooker Lana Lee turning over the ball on several of Kings’ put-ins. However, the pressure was too much and a failed clearance kick from the IC try-line was taken in by the Kings forwards.

From 0-5 down, kicking let IC down again. At the restart, the ball was caught by the opposition 10 who evaded several tackles and showed her pace to cross the try line. The conversion was simple and IC found themselves 0-12 behind.

The half was drawing to a close but not before IC could respond with a try of their own. After the pack drove King’s off their scrum again, substitute Caitlin ‘Red’ Jackson made an immediate impact, picking up the ball from number 8. Handing off three players, Red then off-loaded to scrum half Kath Fok who ran a tight supporting line and was put through in space behind the King’s defense. Sprinting to leave the opposition behind, Kath scored under the sticks and Lana secured the extra points with the conversion.

The second half began with the score at 7-12 and IC immediately turned up the heat on Kings who fumbled the catch from the kick. Strong rucking at the breakdown and more good scrummaging put King’s on the back foot. They attempted to clear their lines from just outside the 5m line, but the King’s kicker was charged down by the face of Kath who followed the ball under the posts to score a second try in a feat of impressive reflexes and creativity. Another conversion from Lana put IC in the lead 14-12.

With the half barely underway, the King’s pack tried to plough their way back making it into the IC 22, but IC were wise not to commit too many players to the breakdown and maintain the defensive line. Turning over the ball in the scrum, the backs carried the ball away. IC were then able to hold their composure, despite high tensions, until the final whistle. The win against a team in a higher league puts the thus far undefeated ICUWRFC at the top of LUSL whilst they await BUCS matches beginning at the end of November.
