A man who described climate change as “created by the Chinese” and “fictional” is now the leader of the free world.

The World Meteorological Organisation, a UN body, recently released data showing that 2011 – 2015 have been the hottest years on record. Moreover, many extreme weather events that occurred during this period have been attributed to man-made climate change. Now is the time for unified, global decisions to be made on tackling climate change.

Trump has previously threatened to pull out of the UN Paris Agreement, ratified by Obama. The Paris Agreement is an agreement within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change covering greenhouse gas emission mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Leaving the deal would only be an option three years after it had been in force, and it came into action last Friday. On top of this, it would take a year to pull out. America is responsible for 13% of the Earth’s greenhouse gas emissions, and under the Paris agreement has agreed to cut emissions by up to 28% by 2025. The legislative promises made by the 200 governments that signed the deal are critical to ensuring that global temperatures are kept below the 2°C threshold ( which is 2°C above pre-industrial revolution levels). One of the world’s biggest emitters going against this deal would have huge ramifications.

Back in May he pledged to cut “$100 billion” of climate change spending. In reality the amount the Federacy sends to the UN is lower, and used to help global communities deal with the effects of climate change. But with all of his sweeping statements, you have to use your imagination. Cutting all of the Department of Energy’s budget, climate change research and funding helping US communities deal with extreme weather events still would not produce the $100 billion in savings promised. In contrast, the Clinton campaign set out clear goals on the issue, and Clinton pledged to make America the “worlds clean energy superpower”.

Trump has also apparently backtracked on his words about climate. In September he said “there is still much that needs to be investigated in the field of climate change”, and “we should be focused on developing energy sources and power production that alleviates the need for dependence of fossil fuels”.

However unclear his intentions, the clear anti-climate statements should not be ignored. Rising seas do not negotiate.
