Last Thursday we, the Food Editors, decided to paint the town red! We hit the “Cyrus Hospitality” event, organised by the Imperial College London Cypriot society.

Yiango invited us along and, being food lovers, it was a great excuse for Carol and I to try something new. Being students we obviously took up her offer as the entrance was free and it was open to everyone.

The guests had an opportunity to try traditional Cypriot sweets like loukoumia (Cyprus delights), siousioukos (a dessert made from grape juice and stuffed with nuts) and halouvas (asemolina and rosewater dessert). There was also pitta bread, fried halloumi (Cyprus cheese), taramosalata and black olives.

I’m not going to lie to you, the beverages were not for the faint hearted. The drinks on offer were zivania and commandaria, and they were very popoular. They were deceptively sweet – masking the large alcohol content.

We loved it, so why not cook something inpsired by Cyprus in your kitchen? Or head out to somewhere where they’ll cook it for you?
