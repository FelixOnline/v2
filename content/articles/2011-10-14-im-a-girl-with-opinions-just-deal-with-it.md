 - This is why you shouldnt allow word processors in the kitchenWhat a load of rubbish  Climb out of your tight little arsehole and stop thinking youre in a position to advise anyone else  You dont consider yourself to be the most attractive girl at Imperial  Good stuff you definitely managed to avoid coming across like an arrogant prickAnd if you are going to write crap at least get it consistent   complaining about common courtesy in the first paragraph then praising your friends for treating you like a lady in the final paragraph displays the kind of idiocy thatll get you treated like walking pussy  Grow upHey  leave  alone s only trying to express a fun opinionNice job youve drawn out a shrieking misogynist already Its perfectly fine according to anon here to treat women as walking pussy provided they display a certain level of idiocy Maybe he s

So I was told that my pseudonym was not particularly inventive, but that’s simply what I am: a girl with opinions. Got a problem with that!? Then go away and read something else. I’m here to get nitty and gritty and talk about the things that others are too afraid to even think about. In such a male-dominated university, it is imperative for us girls to stick together and fight for our rights as equals. I’m not saying that all men are sexist, but some of them don’t even realise they are. Like the other day this guy held a door open for me and I was like, “I can open doors, you know! What, you think my arms aren’t strong enough?”

Boys at Imperial are like children in a sandpit - everyone wants to play with the digger, and I’m the digger. Sure, I keep my hair nice and wear clothes that accentuate my curves, but I’m not an object. I don’t dress to impress, I dress to be the best. I pride myself on looking good, and although I don’t consider myself to be the most attractive girl at Imperial, I think boys are magnetized by my confidence. Girls, if there is one tip I can give you, it’s be happy in yourself and your happiness will shine. I normally find that depressed girls just give up on themselves and let their hair go all frizzy and start wearing baggy jeans. You’re not doing yourselves any favours by giving up on yourselves. Don’t give up on yourselves!

When I was a fresher last year, I was naive and optimistic. I had too much faith in chivalry and I let myself believe that I would be surrounded by Prince Charmings. Err… wrong!! If you think telling me that ‘my tits would make a good addition to your mantlepiece’ is going to succeed in getting me into your bed, then you’re very much mistaken. I can take misogynistic comments on the chin because I’m thick-skinned, but there are some more vulnerable girls starting at Imperial who wouldn’t know how to handle a comment like that. Chat-up lines are a form of sexual harassment and degradation. It’s not funny and it’s definitely not clever.

Not all the boys are pestilent rats. Some of them are actually quite nice, and I would recommend you take your time to find the right one. That’s if you’re looking for anyone at all. If you’re like me, a free spirit, then you might just enjoy the company of intelligent guys that don’t see you as ‘walking pussy’. I’ve got lots of guy friends that treat me as a lady and an equal and I’m glad I’ve found them. When we have our chats, they always listen to what I have to say and let me say my piece. Like I say, I’m not afraid to speak my mind and these guys respect me for that. If I have one piece of advice for you girls, it’s take your time and find the correct social groups for your needs. I hope you enjoyed reading my article :)
