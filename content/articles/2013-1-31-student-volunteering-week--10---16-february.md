Join the team or volunteer as a marshal on the day!

On top of this, the amazing volunteering societies at Imperial will be opening their doors for taster sessions throughout the week, with one off volunteering opportunities, informal chats and more…
## External charities in London are also getting involved!
London Youth, one of the oldest and best-established youth charities in London is holding a session EVERY DAY for Imperial students to attend one of their Urban Nature projects in youth centres across London.
