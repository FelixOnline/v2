What starts off as the kind of play you think will predominantly explore the extremes to which political correctness is taken – sometimes creating just the awkwardness and indignity it hopes to avoid – changes course and ends up shining a very cynical light on the soulless and business-only orientated nature of today’s entertainment business.

__Signal Theatre’s__ – a young Chicago company – _A Place at the Table’s_ dialogue is solid and slick. Yet these brilliant little moments are overwhelmed by the long-winded exchanges that go into much too much detail about the ins and outs of how the Biz operates – rather too much to take on board for the average punter who only watches TV… and even a bit too much for someone who works somewhere in the business (yours truly).

Good job the cast of four was vibrant enough to keep us interested, each actor a delight to watch regardless of whether the script was going through one of its momentary lulls. Christopher Tester is confident and natural as “the disabled playwright” Adam, with a great Benedict Cumberbatch-esque voice, too. Someone you would think has years of acting experience already behind him.

Kellie Batchelor – one of the company’s founders – proves she can play both the screeching chav (I last saw her as the village bicycle Cherry in Anthony Nielson’s The Night Before Christmas), as well as the more yummy mummy end of the spectrum as Sarah the TV executive who starts off wanting to change the world with Adam’s Disabled sitcom, only to turn into just another figures-obsessed media whore.

Jacob Dunn has tremendous presence and energy as Sammy. He is positively terrifying when he enters drunk, under the influence of “a litre of champagne”, and gives Adam a bollocking for not taking his advice to give up trying to get his play made into what would end up as just another sell-out sitcom.

Eva Tausig as Rachel is funny as the rabbit caught in the headlights intern, and then successfully makes the transition into the cockier, more knowledgeable runner in the second half – exchanging her Alice band for a Ramones T-shirt instead.

Director Robert Wolstenholme – another of Signal Theatre’s founders – pulls everything together wonderfully, with some great set design that includes an eye-catching gold BAFTA award replica. Tuesday 28 February was its opening night. Besides less than a handful of barely noticeable line fumbles, one would never have guessed!

___A Place at the Table__ runs until 17 March at the Tristan Bates Theatre. Tickets £10._
