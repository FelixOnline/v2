## Mass Effect: Andromeda
The Mass Effect series was iconic and well deserving of all its recognition. Its ending may have been polarising but it did not take away from the hours of rich game play and world building. It was a thrill to learn that another entry in the series was coming. Although not much is known about this particular game, the limited footage we’ve seen was slick and all the familiar mechanics we know and love - conversations, romances, and shooting things - are back in action. With a release date of 21st March, the hype level of fans is off the charts.

## Yooka-Laylee
Made from one of the biggest kick starters of 2015, this colourful game looks to recreate the fun and glee of old N64 games. Along the duo of Yooka the chameleon and Laylee the bat, players will get to explore huge, breathtaking worlds, interact with a whole host of colourful characters and collect as many…well... collectibles as one possible can. A lighter entry in terms of feel and tone but one which promises a lot of fun.

## Injustice 2
Another sequel (sensing a trend yet?) coming this year is Nether Realm’s Injustice 2. Injustice was well known for pitting the heroes and villains of DC comics against each other. Compared to the first game, this one will allow players to earn and unlock upgrades to characters, giving this fighting game an RPG element to it. With the developer saying it will have the largest roster of any DC fighting game up until now, it will be interesting to see how this one fares.

## For Honour
With intense melee combat between knights, samurai, and even vikings, this game definitely sounds like it will be popular. This is all about sword duels in the midst of large battles, as players aim to anticipate enemy attacks, read their stances and properly strategize to land the killing blow. Other than this, there is said to be a single player campaign that is touted to be varied and engaging; if this game kicks off, Ubisoft will have another franchise to keep gamers hooked.

## The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
Arguably one of the most anticipated games on this list, the latest Legend of Zelda is going to be released on the Wii U and the new upcoming Switch. The trailers have given us a look into a new model with a truly beautiful landscape. Hyrule is now a complete open world where you can enter dungeons as you wish, weapons now degrade over time and you need to forage for food and items. Fans have been waiting for this game for well over a year and hopes are riding high on the latest of Link’s adventures.

## Resident Evil 7: Biohazard
Resident Evil was a series whose focus changed with different instalments but the latest entry is set to bring back everything that defined the franchise in the first place. Exploring a creepy old mansion, this survival horror is expected to give players a constant feeling of dread and suspense. Because this is the first game of the series that will be in first person, the chilling scares are set to be all the more terrifying. This game is even fully playable in VR for those brave souls amongst us wanting the extra layer of tension.
