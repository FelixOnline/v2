Still buzzing after their triumph last week, Imperial were roaring to get at a UCL Medical School (RUMS) side which had evaded defeat in the past five meetings, including a 49-10 drubbing earlier this season. With RUMS 2nd top and IC 2nd from bottom in our league, the scene was set for a tough afternoon.

Returning absentees, including skipper Joe McGrail, gave the home side a steely edge as Imperial looked to put their foot down early. A series of hard carries (particularly from Moorby and CPS in the centres) took IC deep into RUMS territory, and when the visitors infringed trying to stem the tide, Price Smith stepped up and continued his unusual recent trend of converting penalties, to give Imperial the lead. Not satisfied with this, IC came hard at RUMS again. A dazzling run, with some spellbinding footwork, from stage one Billy, got RUMS back peddling again. Field moved the ball quickly out wide to Zaboronksy, who drove over the line to score, with CPS adding the extras.

RUMS finally started to get a bit of a foothold in the game. A few of their big forwards worked out that it was possible to make yards, if only they don’t run at DNS. Their number eight instead ran at Clayton and put an end to what had been a busy 20 minutes from the flanker, by pretty much knocking him out and leaving a sizeable egg on his head (not yet known if either the egg or the dazed Clayton has been re-poached). Thankfully Curtis was on hand to slot in, but the disruption suited RUMS who got back into the game. Firstly with a neatly taken drop goal, then a converted try, with nice footwork taking their big second row past some tired looking defence to leave the half time score at 10-10.

IC came out guns blazing after the break, their set piece dominance giving them a great platform to build off. In his 14th carry of 2017, Matt Blackett chalked up his first metre made which happily got him over the line. Zaboronsky added his second try, utilising a powerful fend and burst of pace, following excellent work from subs Will Carter and Curtis. Carter got involved again with a second lung-bursting break up the middle. The offload didn’t quite go to hand, but instead fell to Miller, who for once was working hard in support. Some good footwork from the prop controlled the ball and got him over the line, to seal a 29-13 bonus point victory for Imperial. Special mention goes to the subs bench, who came on and bolstered a tiring team and steered the ship home.
