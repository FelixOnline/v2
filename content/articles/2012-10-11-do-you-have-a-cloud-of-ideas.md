What if the word “career” meant “fun”, “passion”, and “entrepreneurship”, instead of “oil-platform”, “finance”, or “academia”? We want to show a different set of doors the education at Imperial College unlocks for you far from the obvious and spineless paths Imperial’s flocked careers fairs hold. Imperial College Design Collective (ICDC) demonstrates how knowledge acquired at Imperial can be applied in all design fields.

On Wednesday students from Civil Eng, Electrical Eng, Computing and Mechanical Eng (to name but a few) worked on “Enhancing the cycling experience in London”. Concepts were put forward by members of different teams and developed through the afternoon. Ideas such as a new brake distribution system or a bike detection system for buses were developed. Designer Larissa Kunstel assisted the workshops in the creation and deepening of ideas. We will work on bringing the ideas to real projects this Wednesday and the designer Dominic Thomas, of the legendary award winning Genesis Bikes, will come and review them in person!

This year holds a very exciting programme: our four themes for 2012-2013 are Interactive City, Toys, Emotions and Personality, and Barriers. Members of the society will enjoy an in-depth view of each theme through hands-on workshops led by professionals and academics from Imperial and the Royal College of Arts.

No specific skills are required, but a smile, a cloud of ideas and a will to share them. We encourage people from all different backgrounds to join as there is no such thing as irrelevant knowledge when it comes to creativity as we saw in our first workshop.

ICDC maintains connections with distinguished and prominent designers, architects and manufacturers who will provide us with insight and guidance. By organising regular talks, office visits and exhibitions, we will further allow for Design to play a larger role at Imperial.

If you believe that Design, Science and Technology are complimentary fields and if you want to see what kind of remarkable things can happen at their junction, then like our Facebook page “Imperial College Design Collective” to access our talks and events and come to our workshops!
