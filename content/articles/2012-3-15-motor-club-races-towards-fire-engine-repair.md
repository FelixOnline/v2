Members of [RCS Motor Club](http://union.ic.ac.uk/rcc/rcsmotor/) have got one stop closer to fully repairing Jezebel, the [RCSU](http://rcsu.org.uk/exec/)’s 1916 fire engine, after successful remetalling of an engine bearing, and reconstruction of the engine. Jezebel has been off the road since the end of last year, following an engine fault when travelling back from Brighton.

The new bearing has been produced in house by the club, utilising the expertise of the club’s alumni members. Following part of a metal ingot being molten down and cast to form the new bearing, it was then machined and etched to form a good fit with the engine. The engine has now been rebuilt, with distinctive features such as the pots, radiator, and lights now reattached.

Jezebel now runs again under her own power, and is capable of driving around, however, there is still reassembly work to do, such as reattaching the bonnet, before the repair is complete. These alterations are expected to be completed soon.

The club have also recorded the production of the new bearing, with a view to produce this into a video released to the general public.
