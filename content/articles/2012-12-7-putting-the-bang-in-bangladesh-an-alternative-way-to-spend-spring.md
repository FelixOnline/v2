Tor many, life has been normal so far; most have attended school, the lucky progressing onto university, the majority then graduating. However, I realised the next 10 years of my (professional) life could creep up on me as quickly as the last 16 years, during which time I was being unwittingly conveyor-belted along an education system and churned out into real life. I felt like doing something different, just for a while.

‘Normal’ life in the UK is considered to be one of privilege and opportunity. But this isn’t how the global picture looks. How often do stop to wonder why, let alone do anything about it? While deciding my next step after university, I chose to defer my job and volunteer. In reading this I hope you consider doing the same.

On 22 January 2013 I will begin a 3-month volunteering placement in Bangladesh. I will be living as the locals do, collaborating with other overseas volunteers, local communities and organisations to address problems faced by severely impoverished communities in Bangladesh. The focus is on groups who are otherwise excluded from social and economic growth and who are less resilient to economic and environmental shocks. (See end for more details.)

Statistics surrounding poverty are inaccessible and emotions can easily be rationalised with our busy schedules and daily commitments. But poverty should never have become an acceptable thing to live with.

While I’m aware many of us already volunteer in this country and donate to charity when we can, many of us think we’re unable to reach those in distant countries, because we lack the capital and the time. However, with the help of donations and government grants, VSO empowers 18-25 year olds, such as us fresh graduate meat, to lend our hands and brains for good in some of the most impoverished destinations on Earth.

Bangladesh, for example, suffers from widespread childhood malnutrition, and has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the world. There is also a high incidence of preventable diseases, due to the lack of access to and information about sanitation, hygiene, nutrition and sexual health.

The opportunity to address these issues first hand requires a bit of commitment on my own soil before I leave; I am required to fundraise a minimum of £800. This not only raises awareness for the scheme so that others are encouraged to get involved in fighting against poverty, but it facilitates young people like us to take part.

So for those looking to do something memorable before knuckling down to a job for the rest of your life, consider volunteering your young, imaginative minds to VSO. And when that time comes, you’ll be in my shoes recruiting the attention and generosity of your peers to act against poverty.

But for now, you can make a difference from the comfort of your Library desk, your lecture theatre or your bedroom. Lend your support by visiting the page below to donate. Otherwise, keep your nostrils dilated for the scent of a bake sale next week on campus and buy some delicious cakes. To keep track of the various fundraising events I’ll be doing.
