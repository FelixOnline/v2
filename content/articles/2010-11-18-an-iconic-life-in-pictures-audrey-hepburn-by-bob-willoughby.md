Yet another photographic tome on the ubiquitous Ms Audrey Hepburn – there are so many out there now that if you didn’t know better, this one, by the late renowned Hollywood photographer Bob Willoughby is just another one on the shelf.

I would beg to differ. Bob Willoughby’s favourite subject, amongst all of the 1950s Hollywood starlets including Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor and Jane Fonda, was Audrey, whom he photographed from her ascent to fame after her Oscar-winning performance in Roman Holiday until her brilliant turn as Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady in 1963. He said of her, “She took my hand like... Well, a princess, and dazzled me with that smile that God designed to melt mortal men’s hearts.”

“She took my hand like...well a princess, and dazzled me with that smile that God designed to melt mortal men’s hearts.”

He captured her on and off-set, in the most beautiful, tender photographs – a product of a great friendship – which are chronicled in this breathtaking Tiffany blue-bound book. With stills from Breakfast At Tiffany’s, Paris When It Sizzles and My Fair Lady to intimate photographs of Audrey at home with her pet deer, Ip, the book is completely delightful, a glamorous insight, and a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most beautiful faces of the 20th century.

Published by Taschen, who ran a limited run of one thousand Collector’s Editions retailing at £450 which sold out almost instantly just on pre-sale, there is talk of a more affordable edition coming out soon - fingers crossed - this is definitely one for the Hepburn-lover’s Christmas list!
