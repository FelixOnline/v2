On Tuesday Oct 1, Meat Soc held its primary trip this academic year to the Green Door Steakhouse, on Gloucester Road. It was great to meat new members, and to ketchup with some of our older ones. We felt that we should begin in style, dining on really good food.
 The food and the service at the restaurant were excellent; and the price of the vast majority of the main courses was reasonable. The steaks were high, but the restaurant rose to the challenge. The food portions were generous, the waiters were attentive (appearing and disappearing quietly at intervals), and they brought the bill in good time.
 Rather oddly for a food review, I have nothing negative to say, and we had no bones to pick with the restaurant. All of those present at our first meeting would recommend the Green Door Steakhouse; all of the meals ordered looked excellent (especially the beef ribs); and everyone looked as though they were having fun. To not have gone there would have been a missed-steak. It may not be appropriate for a student on a tight budget, but if you are looking for a really good meal with good service, we highly recommend it.

For our next trip, a chicken wing eating contestâ€¦
