This is not the kind game that our section would usually review. In fact, when I told my fellow games editor Calum what I was planning to write about, he retorted in disgust “that’s not a proper game!” However, I believe that mobile gaming is here to stay, which means that we should start considering them. Also, the addictiveness of QuizUp could not be discounted.

So for all of those of you who do not know what this game is, let me quickly give you the low down on this super app. It’s a free game created by Plan Vanilla Corp which is currently only on iOS. Basically a trivia quiz, it encompasses more than 350 topics for you to show off your knowledge. You answer 7 multiple choice questions in a game, attempting to answer as fast as possible. The longer it takes for you to answer the less points you get for the answer. However the twist is that you play can real-time versus others on the Internet, challenging for title of greatest know-it-all across the globe. Furthermore if you link your Facebook account to the game you can play your friends! This competitive element does add a lot to me wanting to play.

Another element that adds to the compulsive nature of the game is the levelling and experience that accompany each result after a round of the quiz. Not only can you show off your supremeness of your brain, but you can also gain titles related to the subject you level up in.

Considering that each game lasts maximum a minute, and you almost immediately know if you are going to win it is a great way to kill a few minutes if you are waiting.

So why do I think that you should get this app? Well its free (you can pay for experience boosts if you really want to), it’s a great way to learn random facts that you may never encounter at Imperial (like the only beer that Ernest Hemmingway endorsed in his life), and it’s a great ice-breaker (I mean, if you are too awkward to actually ask someone out, you could always ask them on a subject that implies what you want). Come all you quizmasters out there, time to answer ALL the questions!
