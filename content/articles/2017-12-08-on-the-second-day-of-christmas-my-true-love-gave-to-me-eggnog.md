You will need...

- 700ml whole milk
- 250ml double cream
- 5 eggs
- 3 cinnamon sticks
- 1 tbsp vanilla essence/pods
- 1 tsp nutmeg
- 150g granulated sugar
- 200ml dark rum (I know you want more, but you need to keep it low for the consistency)

1. In a saucepan, combine the milk, double cream, cinnamon, vanilla (you can choose to use either vanilla pods or vanilla extract – personally, I prefer the latter because it’s easier to use), and nutmeg. Mix well, until the mixture is homogeneous. 
1. Bring to a boil. Before that you should have a taste, to see if you want more vanilla or nutmeg in it. It’s going to be more difficult to add them afterwards.
1. In a bowl, using a hand mixer, beat the egg yolks and the sugar until they thicken. 
1. Slowly add the milk mixture and continue mixing. Your final product should be smooth.
1. Add the rum. Try not to add too much rum. I mean, after doing this much work you don’t want to ruin it.
1. Refrigerate. Before serving, beat the egg whites till fluffy and fold into the eggnog until combined.
