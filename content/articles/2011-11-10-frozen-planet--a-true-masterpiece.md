The advent of digital satellite broadcasting brought with it a torrent of mind-numbing programs (including certain controversial chat shows…) aimed at an audience with the collective sentient ability of a squashed banana (sorry, I simply couldn’t resist!). So from this seemingly endless stream of drivel, it is rare to find such a veritable gem of broadcasting merit as David Attenborough’s latest offering: [_Frozen Planet_](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00mfl7n).

What we have here is an impeccable exposition of the best of the BBC juxtaposed with the best of nature: the culmination of over six years worth of filming time in some of the toughest environments on this planet. From amazing under-ice footage (the result of over 134 hours of filming under Arctic sea ice) to close-ups of entire pods of orcas, this show makes for unforgettable viewing.

The seven part series, the very love child of the BBC and Mother Nature, concentrates on the changing seasons at the poles, with the first three episodes (covering Spring and Summer) having aired already (and currently available on iPlayer). Whilst concentrating on the cycle of life, the show does also examine man’s activities in these regions. But even if you are as much the climate skeptic as I am, don’t be put off: the breathtaking scenes and stories throughout do more than make up for this.

From the kleptomaniac habits of penguins, to the clinical team hunting skills of orcas, _Frozen Planet_ has much in store for the viewer. Some flawless time-lapse photography coupled with stunning close-ups shots effectively portray life in this, the most seasonal of places. In addition, some spectacular aerial shots give magnificent views of the barren expanse of the tundra, whilst the HD is certainly noticeable.

The BBC producers have, once again, excelled themselves. Epic slow motion shots of two 4-ton elephant seals fighting to control a harem of over 50 females are a sight to behold, especially as these mountains of blubber waddle to the battlefield. As these ‘beachmasters’ do battle the music of George Fenton aptly provides a certain sense of grandeur to the whole affair. With excerpts that at times hark back to the scores of John Williams, it is clear from where Fenton gets his inspiration, but the music is sublime in complementing the filming.

None of this would be as impressive without the wise, yet dulcet, tones of [Sir David Attenborough](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9ob9WdbXx0). Now in his 85th year, and with over 57 years of experience in the field, there can be no doubt that _Frozen Planet_ hangs on his every word. With his unique descriptions of everything from courtship and through to survival techniques, he provides that essential refinement that makes this show special.

A nice addition to each episode is a 20-minute addendum known as ‘Freeze Frame’ (pun probably intended). Interviews and commentaries with the indefatigable crew chronicle the risks, including 130mph windstorms, faced in filming the program. It becomes apparent that it was a serious undertaking to produce a show of this calibre, and this only goes to emphasise why you should watch it: if only to make your TV licence payment worthwhile.

I cannot extoll the virtues of this program enough. This documentary is nothing short of a masterpiece. Not only is it both beautiful and informative, but is also, dare I say, cool. Don’t let yourself miss it.
