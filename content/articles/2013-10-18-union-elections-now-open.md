Union elections are kicking off again on Friday 17 at 12pm, they will be open till Tuesday 22 at 12pm.

These elections are for Reps and Union Council. This year 464 students in total have stood for elections for 115 positions. This shows an increase to the number of total candidates that ran last year, which was 390, even though last year there were more positions available at a total of 139.

Rebecca Coxhead the returning officer stated “This is a brilliant way to get involved and be part of ensuring student views are expressed to the right bodies to make changes for the benefit of students. Whether you want to be involved with representing your Year Group or Master’s cohort to your. Department, or be one of the ‘voice of the students’ in Union Council, we hope this guide will help you.”

So make sure you vote if you want your voice heard.
