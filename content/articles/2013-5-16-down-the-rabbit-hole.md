I went along to the final of the Uni Music League last week having heard only one song by James and the Rabbit Hole. I didn’t know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. The band only formed early this year (following an application to the competition) and since then their main focus has been writing enough songs to play in the rounds of the competition as they sailed through them one after another. The Uni Music League is the biggest student music competition with a big prize (an EP recording deal with Metropolis Studios, a slot at Wilderness Festival, places as a support act at KOKO, a PR campaign and pro photo shoots) and so the band worked hard. By the final they had six of their own songs (having written the most recent song two days beforehand) and had accumulated a very appreciative crowd. They started the set with a cover of Daft Punk ‘Get Lucky’, a current sure-fire hit. They really did the song justice and sent the crowd wild from just a few notes in. It was easy to understand why the crowd was so excited about the band.

The lead singer, James Burrows, is an incredibly capable vocalist with a very enjoyable twang to his voice that reminded me a little of Jason Mraz. During the set, he was often accompanied by harmonies from guitarist Tim Plummer. Each musician in James and the Rabbit Hole has obvious talent and this was showcased in brilliant solos from each of them over several of the songs. The drummer, Dan Day, switches between a huge variety of drum rhythms with ridiculous ease and the keys player, Francis Clegg, treated the crowd to some brilliant jazz-style solos on the top half of the keyboard, leaving them wanting much more. James and the Rabbit Hole’s music marries several genres from rock to soul and yet is far from over-complicated, taking us back to classic old-school funk that many bands shy away from these days, but is simply enjoyable as ever. The varying textures within the songs were skilled, as were the transitions between the songs. Several songs were stopped dead perfectly, with quick movement into the next song, much to the listeners’ delight. Others were interlaced with amusing stage chat. Throughout the set the band were constantly interacting with each other to keep in perfect sync and at the right levels, but also just through enjoyment of playing the music. And the enjoyment was infectious. At several points James took to jumping across the stage with his colourful guitar and grey desert boots, shaking his black hair, showing the level of energy that this kind of music is all about. At one point the drummer acquired a straw hat and was drumming on his feet. I’m not sure what the hat was for but it contributed to a very inclusive and amusing set from the band.

Unfortunately James and the Rabbit Hole didn’t win the Uni Music League competition, but this is far from the last we’ll be hearing of the band. They already have a dedicated following and are planning more gigs and recordings. I can’t wait for the next performance.
