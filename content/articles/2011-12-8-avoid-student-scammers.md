Since the start of term Imperial students have lost thousands of pounds to practised conmen and women. ‘How could they be so stupid?’ you might wonder… it’s not as straightforward as that. These people employ all sorts of tactics – and they’re doing their Christmas shopping. Below are examples of the three most common scams, all of which have happened to IC students since the beginning of term:

_1. Help me, I’m in a pinch!_

In this scam, a female (though it could just as easily be a male) approaches a student claiming that she lives in Enismore Gardens, she has been locked out of her house, her children have been in a car accident and she has no husband. She then asks for money to pay for a taxi to the hospital. She has stolen significant sums this way.

_2. Help me I’m having a hard time – I used to be rich._

Here, students meet a model who has fallen on hard times but has suitcases full of (fake) designer gear. They are leftover from his catwalk days; he is willing to part with them cheap cheap cheap. ‘Come in the car – we’ll just go to my flat.’ At this point most students say ‘no Thank you.’ Usually this is fine. Sometimes the ‘model’ and his ‘friend’ get aggressive. When students get into the car, which they have in the past, the real trouble starts. Don’t let it happen to you.

_3. You sir – yes, you sir, STOP, I’m the police! _

Man A: “Excuse me, do you have the way to the Royal Albert Hall? I think it’s here on this map.” Imperial Student: “But of course, I’m kind and helpful, it’s just this way.” Men B and C pretending to be police: “Oi, we suspect you of a drug deal. We need to search you.” Imperial student, in good faith: “Oh, ok, of course.” Police impersonators then empty the student’s wallet and run. Not good. Many students do not know how to distinguish a police impersonator from the real deal, or what a proper Stop and Search looks like. Whether you agree with the principle or not, the police do stop and search and it’s worth knowing what a warrant card looks like (see photo). To watch or take part in a Stop and Search, to find out more about these scams and others, and to learn how to protect yourself, come to the Safety Session in Pippard Lecture Theatre in Sherfield at 12:30pm on Tuesday 13 December. Good personal safety freebies will be available! Feel free to email [dpwelfare@ic.ac.uk](mailto:dpwelfare@ic.ac.uk) with any questions.
