__How the Tutorial System works__

As an Imperial student, you have access to dedicated staff members whose job it is to make sure that any problems you have during your course, be they academic or non-academic, are resolved. They have different names depending on your course level; you have probably met some of the tutors during meetings scheduled by your Department. You can talk to them about any and all problems you’re having, and it’s a good idea to keep in close contact with them as they are a valuable source of support and guidance. This person should be easily contactable and available to meet with you. If you have a problem and can’t contact them, or if they are difficult to contact you can talk to a more senior member of staff who will work to ensure that the person is more contactable/responsive in future and who can offer an alternative source of help.

Especially now during the exam period, it is important that your let your tutors know should you encounter any difficulties or circumstances which impinge upon your revision or report writing. They will be able to advise you on how to go about resolving this or point you in the right direction.

__Who’s there for me?__

Most undergraduates should know who their tutors are, however, postgraduate tutors are listed below. Masters students also each have a Personal Tutor. This is usually a member of academic staff allocated to you for the duration of your course to offer help and support and follow your personal progress. MSc students can contact their Course Coordinator/Convenor if they’re having issues with their Personal Tutor. MRes students will each have a project supervisor and can contact the Postgraduate Tutor in their department as an alternative source of support.

Postgraduate Research (PhD) students have a mentor and a supervisor (and possibly a second supervisor). Their Postgraduate Tutor also has a welfare role and will normally be the first source of advice if there are difficulties with (or between) supervisors. Research students who are unhappy with these can contact the College Tutors, especially if the nature of the difficulty extends outside your home department.
