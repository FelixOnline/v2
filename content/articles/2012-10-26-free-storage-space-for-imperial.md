 - Loving it DJust an fyi Gb stands for Gigabits You should use GB for Gigabytes Great spot mate ChangedNice spot AlexWhy is Imperial placed 3rd and 26th at the same time on the leaderboard Imperial have two email address domains i think thats what its called There is one which is imperialacuk and a shorter one icacuk Annoyingly Dropbox does not see this as the same university so there are two Imperials on the list Im pretty sure icacuk is the least popular one ranking 26th as Im sure more people at Imperial know about the longer domain than this oneDropbox should probably combine the two together so Imperial have the correct number of points

Every student at Imperial can get 8GB worth of free storage on the online website Dropbox. This is part of the Dropbox SpaceRace.

In this competition student race against each other to earn more points, which entitles them to more space online in the Dropbox website. Imperial is currently third in the United Kingdom (table pictured to the left), with 2,233 participants (at time of writing).

The competition works by students registering with their Imperial email address, or, if you have an account under a different email address, verifying that you go to Imperial on the Dropbox Space Race website. The more students who sign up, the more free space that every student at that institution gets. Currently, at time of going to print, Imperial students are able to get 8GB worth of free space. The maximum possible space that an institution can gain is 25GB.

Usually, the amount of space given to each user is 5GB. The extra 3GB to Imperial students will, however, only be available for two years.

The competition was launched on Monday 15 October, and will run for eight weeks, meaning two of the weeks have already gone.
