 - Just picking up on a few things As a CSM player the emphasis on RSMs dominance  on this report offends both me and my team Due to a series of bad decisions by the referee on both sides I will admit and some injuries the game was not as close as we would have hoped However your slimy comments and unjust description of RSM being all over CSM running in tries everywhere is a ridiculous exaggeration Talking with your boys after the game both teams agreed that it was a 5 point match therefore it could have gone either way on any day See you boys next year Oh CSM is wonderfullTry and be gracious in defeat youre just being a sore loserAnd you sir as well as the writer of this report are being very bad winnersWell Dave it is an Imperial magazine I dont know what you expect 12000 handwritten paiapcirtnts names and handsigned signature from the Chairman EXCO NDP 2010 Im impressed Col Benedict Lim Thats a nice touch that makes a BIG differenceA BIG Thank You to ALL paiapc

Last weekend saw the battle commence [in this year’s Bottle Match](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/3279/the-111th-bottle-match/), which for anyone who doesn’t know what this is, it’s the varsity between the Royal School of Mines and their rivals Cambourne School of Mines. The varsity consists of seven different sports starting with the tame contests of squash and golf on the Friday afternoon, the tense netball in the evening followed by an early start for hockey and football on Saturday morning, these lead into the main event; the rugby.

This year we couldn’t have had a better start with a whitewash in the squash; with only one set being dropped by an RSM player. The success of the golf came soon after due to some good old Irish luck that boosted the team through the freezing conditions. Some players took the miners tradition to steady their hand, merry spirits and ignite fire in our strictly athletic bodies. Golf brought home a 3-1 victory.

Netball was going to be tense this year, with a tightly contested match last year that resulted in the RSM losing for the first time. The RSM girls had prepared well but CSM had obviously still been training hard. After the third quarter the RSM had built up a 21-14 lead and were looking dominant. CSM put in a storming last quarter, but luckily RSM held out for a narrow winning margin of 27-25.

Then came Saturday’s activities. At an unsociable hour of 9am the Ladies Hockey pushed-back, with the supporters already preparing themselves against the weather with trusty beer jackets. RSM were dictating play winning successive short corners but failing to convert. Just before half time Gigi managed to scored an amazing reverse stick goal into the bottom corner. However as was a common fate of the Bottle Match this year CSM came back fighting and got a lucky goal, with the RSM failing to convert their multiple opportunities the result ended in a draw, meaning that CSM retained the cup.

The men’s hockey was up next, this proved tobe much more tense than previous encounters. The ball moving quickly from end to end but some brilliant defence from Jonney Jones, Freddie BM Briggs and Harry Fisher and some dramatic saves from Keeper Jonney kept the CSM attack at bay. Half time was 0-0 and looked promising. Early in the second half a save on the line unfortunately came off a foot and gave CSM a penalty flick and a 1-0 lead. The game was so close and this was the only goal, hopefully next year we can right the score line.

Saturday had not had the best of starts but the supporters make the day enjoyable for all. The additions of a burger van helping to keep everyone going for the all important rugby.
 The football was a tricky match for the RSM team and the strength of the CSM through the midfield just gave them too many chances on goal, despite the valiant effort from the RSM keeper. The final result being a disappointing 4-0 loss, however with some key players returning from years abroad next year we hope to take a strong team down to Cambourne next year.

Finally the Rugby! With an emphatic victory last year the RSM didn’t know what to expect from CSM this year. The RSM started well breaking the CSM defence and putting them on edge but some scramble defence just saving CSM. A turn in play gave CSM a penalty and they took an unexpected 3-0 lead. Their points were quickly answered by a try from James Cox whose pace and kicking was just too much for CSM to handle. The rugby became hazy for some supporters but all I can say is that we were all over them running in tries from Robbie Cowan and Ali Jones. CSM did manages to sneak in a try in the second half making their score more respectable. Fred White who had been dangerous all game, causing trouble on the wing got a try at the death and bringing the Bottle home! Credit must be given to Captain James Scaife who lead the team on the fieldand made some tough tactical substitutions during the game. Also to Henry Bleech for organising the weekend so brilliantly .
