Imperial College Neuroscience Society will be holding their annual conference on the 27th of January, 2018, in the Sir Alexander Fleming Building (South Kensington Campus). There are several exciting talks and workshops planned, covering wide-ranging topics, from neuropsychiatry and advances in cognitive neuroscience, to live brain dissections and clinical neuroscience! As ever, food and refreshments will be provided throughout the day.

We are proud to welcome a variety of renowned speakers who are experts in their fields, and will provide an engaging and enlightening experience. This year, we have included TWO live brain dissection workshops with Professor Steve Gentleman, who will also explain the use of the Parkinson Brain Bank at Imperial College London. 

We have more speakers than ever before joining our symposia, with several keynote talks. These speakers include Dr. Edward Wild, a specialist in neuro-genetics, as well as Dr. Bianca Jupp, who has an interest in the neurobiology of addiction. Speakers will discuss not only the clinical aspects of neuroscience – as will be seen in Dr. Lim’s talk on neuro-inflammation – but also technological and scientific advances in neuroscience as will be demonstrated by Prof. Sven Bestmann’s talk on models for non-invasive brain stimulation in health and disease. Specialist talks will cover areas such as paediatric neuroscience, discussed by Dr. Lucinda Carr, as well as various aspects of cognitive neuroscience presented by Dr. Qadeer Arshad and Dr. Parashkev Nachev! 

Visit our Facebook page for further speaker details, and the list of speaker announcement closer to the event date!

There will be an informal careers event after the talk which many of the speaker will attend, giving you the opportunity to meet some of the speakers and discuss their work further! 
We are also now accepting abstract submissions! Don’t miss a chance to present your research to peers, as well as the speakers attending the event. We will be awarding certificates for the best posters with the help of our expert judges.  Hope to see you all there!
