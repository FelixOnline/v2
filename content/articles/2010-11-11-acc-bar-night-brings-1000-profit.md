The first Athletics Club Committee (ACC) Bar Night of the year took place on Wednesday 3rd November, raising over £1000 for various sporting clubs, with the success being hailed as the beginning of “a new age for the Union”.

A turnout of 600 people helped put the newly opened FiveSixEight bar to the test with a record 27 kegs being served in under 2 hours; the fact that there was damage caused to the men’s toilets did not deter attendees from finishing off all of the beer and cider on offer.

The profit made will be recirculated to ACC clubs, which this year have all suffered budget cuts.

ACC Chair, Monya Zard gave her thanks to all the clubs attending and said “we are looking forward to the next event where we can test out the capabilities of Metric, hopefully there will be even more kegs.”

Deputy President (Finance & Services) Ravi Pall was particularly pleased with how the event passed, saying in a blogpost that he was “impressed with the way the ACC conducted themselves on the night, with only a few minor incidents; which is a drastic change to previous years.” He also responded to the overall praise of the lack of queues, claiming that this is “truly a testament to the serving capacity of FiveSixEight.”

The next ACC Bar Night will be held on the 8th December.
