Brian May and Roger Taylor from Queen were at Imperial in Metric on Tuesday 5 March to unveil a plaque commemorating their first public performance, which took place in the Union Concert Hall.
 The event was greeted with much enthusiasm by all present, with Paul Beaumont, Union President, giving in a speech in the traditional rock and roll attire of a suit. Beaumont said: “We’re very proud of Imperial College Union’s musical past, including the small role we played in the Queen story. It’s a privilege to host a plaque commemorating the band’s first London performance here and to welcome them back here today.”

The event was a music Heritage Award from PRS for Music. Brian May said: “The first proper gig we did was at Imperial College in the Union Hall. I remember it very distinctly because I’d seen all sorts of people playing in there. I’d been part of the Entertainment Committee and we booked a group every Saturday night in those days. People like Spooky Tooth and Steamhammer! We booked Jimi Hendrix too. So for us it was a dream come true to actually play on that stage. It used to get packed in there so it was a major stepping stone for us.” Roger Taylor continued: “Imperial College was effectively our positional and spiritual base and means a lot to Queen. Many good memories, without it... who knows?”.

Guy Fletcher 0BE, PRS Chair, said: “Loved by millions the world over, they were often thought of as the People’s Band. Queen’s songwriting originality combined musicianship with real life emotion sustaining generations of dedicated fans. It will be an enormous honour to present Brian and Roger with the PRS for Music Heritage award at such a fine institution.

A plucky George Butcher from IC Radio asked Brian and Roger if they would consider doing a live session for them.

After that everyone got pictures andautographs. Including one lucky student, who got Brian to sign his guitar for him.

The actual plaque itself will be placed outside on Prince Consort Road, after a brief stint in Metric.
