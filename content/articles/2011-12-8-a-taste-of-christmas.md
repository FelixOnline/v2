__[Hotel Chocolat](http://www.hotelchocolat.co.uk/) is the hotel of your Christmas dreams__

A luxurious hotel must always include king size bedrooms, royal breakfast, at least one swimming pool, a spa, a gym, a posh bar or... just the greatest chocolate in the UK! I’m talking about Hotel Chocolat, the cocoa grower and chocolatier every choco-lover must have visited at least once.

At Hotel Chocolat you will find any kind of chocolate you can imagine; from milk, dark and white chocolate bars for the traditionally minded, to chocolate fondue and champagne truffles for the more adventurous. Whether you’re looking for a Christmas gift or a treat to sweeten your tooth, this is the place to visit. Many may argue chocolate here is a bit pricey, and it’s true, but – believe me – you are getting the highest quality in the market. Milk chocolate cups filled with layers of praline and salted caramel. Irresistibly cute Christmas Crackers, with space to write your guests’ names and with a gorgeous filled chocolate hiding inside – perfect as table settings or as smart tree decorations.

__Warm up your winter with [Starbucks](http://starbucks.co.uk/)__

The last few days, the temperature has been falling dramatically, making me think that my flight back to beautiful Greece near the end of December may be cancelled like last year. There’s not much to do but wear more clothes, buy more tissues and stay in the warm labs the most you can. If all of this has proven in vain, grab one of the Starbucks family of Red Cup hot drinks. Especially designed for the Christmas season – when people tend to spend more money – the Toffee Nut Latte, Eggnog Latte, Gingerbread Latte and the Mocha Praline are just what you need to celebrate the festivities; if what you need to celebrate Christmas is a non-reusable paper cup.

Customer alert: Starbucks’ fancy drinks, as any other’s major coffee shop, consist of a shot of mediocre espresso, plenty of milk, a few milligrams of the syrup they get their name from and whipped cream on top. So keep in mind: these are not coffee drinks – not even latte – although I must admit they are very enjoyable during the cold days.

__[Bottlegreen](http://www.bottlegreendrinks.com/) Spiced Berry Cordial__

 A classic winter warmer combining blackcurrants, aronia berries, and spice, this cordial is best mixed with hot water although warm red wine is the choice to go with to capture the full essence of Christmas. When the cold days are over, if you have some cordial left try mixing it with sparkling water; it’s just as refreshing as a soda and very tasty.
 Available also in these flavours: Pomegranate & Elderflower, Sparkling Ginger & Lemongrass Presse, Lemongrass with Ginger Cordial, and many more.

__[Cherizena](http://cherizena.co.uk/cherizena_coffee_shop/index.php) Christmas Coffee__

Colombian filter coffee flavored with rum nuts, orange, and spices. A “different” choice for those seeking an intriguing coffee smell of high quality at an affordable price, Cherizena offers a wide selection of flavored coffee satisfying even the most demanding: caramel fudge, Tennessee whiskey, sticky gingerbread, chocolate orange, and cinnamon are just a few of the available flavours. Nice!
