This week the Complete University Guide (CUG) released their latest ranking table for Universities within the United Kingdom. Imperial College saw their ranking diminish from 4th to 6th â€“ a drop that saw the College overtaken in the standings by St Andrews and Durham, who took 4th and 5th respectively.

The rankings were topped by Cambridge, who were followed by Oxford and the London School of Economics. Imperial were not the only university to fall within the top ten though, as University College London also dropped two places to 9th. A lot of the changes in the rankings are thought to be due to a change in the system, with major changes in how graduate employment is viewed and rated.
