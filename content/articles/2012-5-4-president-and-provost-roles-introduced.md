Imperial College is to have a Provost. Where once there was a Rector there will be two positions, a “President & Rector” and a “Provost of the College”. What is a Provost, one wonders. By definition, a provost is the head of a college. What, then, is a rector?

Following a decision by Imperial’s Council, the governing body of the College, Imperial’s leadership arrangements are set to change. The distinction between the two new roles is clear; the President & Rector will oversee all functions with particular emphasis on external matters both in the UK and overseas including alumni and industry while the Provost will focus more on academic affairs. The Provost will report to the President & Rector. Chair of Imperial’s Council Baroness Manningham-Buller believes the change will “allow Imperial to maintain its position as one of the world’s top universities” in the face of “tough challenges” to higher education.
> The new leadership model is not as alien as it might sound
The challenges Baroness Manningham-Buller refers to are reduced state funding for UK universities and competition between universities for the best students and staff. Splitting the role of Rector enables the President & Rector to focus on building relationships with alumni, governments, industry and supporter, promote Imperial and raise funds, and the Provost on Imperial’s fundamental academic mission – education, research and translation.

On Monday 30 April 2012, Sir Keith O’Nions assumed the position of President & Rector while a search for the first Provost was launched. However, Sir Keith is due to retire at the end of 2013. Therefore, in addition to the current search for Provost, a search for a President & Rector to succeed Sir Keith will commence at the end of May 2012. Thus the new leadership arrangement will not be fully in place until the end of 2013.

The new leadership model is not as alien as it might sound. Indeed, it is well-established in many American universities including Harvard, Princeton and Stanford universities to name but a few. Sir Keith said of his new role, “The President & Rector, as the College’s leader, will promote Imperial’s position as a global university, moving it into a different league in terms of development potential, and influence of higher education and research policy. The Provost will ensure the standard and quality of the academic programme is maintained and enhanced.”
