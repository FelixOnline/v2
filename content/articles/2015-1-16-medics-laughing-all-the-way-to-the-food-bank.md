Imperial medical students made a last-minute but sizable donation to the local food bank earlier this month, after collecting dried goods before the Christmas bop at the end of last year.

Students brought non-perishable foods to the Reynolds building on the last day of the autumn term, which were crated up and collected by the local food bank after Christmas. Three crates were filled all in all: amassing to a total of just under 44kg of food that included tinned goods, pasta and cartons of juice and long life milk.

The amount of food collected will be able to feed between 8 to 10 people for up to three days. The food bank, which serves Hammersmith and Fulham residents, donates the collections to those in the local area who are referred to the centre by social services, their local GP, their school or any other frontline care professionals.

Daphine Aikens, a member of staff who works at the bank, spoke to Felix. Daphine thanked the students of Imperial for the kind donation, and told us what a difference it can make to those who are in difficult circumstances.

“People who come to the food bank may not have eaten for days on end and may not even know where there next meal will come from.

“It is great that we can say the donations came from someone in the local community, including a medical student from Charing cross hospital, or a mum who lives down the street or a local business. That is very powerful and meaningful to these people receiving the food.”

The collection was organised by the Imperial College School of Medicine Student’s Union (ICSMSU), and Mala Mawkin, the current social secretary, told us how inspiring it was to see classmates and other students donating to the cause. Mala said “What was really nice was that even though we were all poor students by the end of last term, everyone still was giving what they could to the people that needed it most.”

ICSMSU President, Dariush Hassanzadeh-Baboli concluded: “We are very proud of our students. This goes to show the amazing community spirit at ICSM and the students’ willingness to help those in need in the local community.”

Students who are keen on getting involved are welcome to contact the Food Bank directly via their website: __http://hammersmithfulham.foodbank.org.uk.__
