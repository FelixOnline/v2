Over 3,500 graduands made their way across the stage of the Royal Albert Hall this Wednesday to receive their degrees during the postgraduate graduation ceremony.

Students who had completed masters and doctorates made their way to the South Kensington campus from more than 60 countries, with friends, family, and supporters in tow. The ceremonies were live-streamed on YouTube.

The three graduation ceremonies, held throughout the day, saw hundreds of gown-wearing graduands milling around campus, despite the inclement weather.

Professor Alice Gast, President of Imperial College London, spoke at the ceremony. She highlighted the importance technological changes would have on their lives, particularly artificial intelligence. She told graduates they were “prepared to navigate and contribute to this new era”, and urged them to “listen to the world around us”.

Imperial also conferred honorary degrees to five people on Wednesday, including Sir Keith O’Nions, former President and Rector of Imperial. Other recipients of honorary degrees included: Dr Demis Hassabis, founder of DeepMind; Professor Mary Robinson, who advocates for sustainable development and justice for climate change victims; Dame Mary Archer, an expert in solar energy conversion; and Professor Dame Sally Davies, founder of the National Institute for Health Research and England’s Chief Medical Officer.
Five individuals were awarded Imperial College medals, and twelve individuals and groups were awarded President’s medals for “contribution to the life and work of the College”. 

Five students were awarded Outstanding Student Achievement Awards.

The next graduation ceremony will be the undergraduate graduation ceremony, to be held next October.
