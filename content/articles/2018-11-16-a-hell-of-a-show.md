The room at Jermyn Street Theatre immediately transports the audience one hundred years back in time. Shelves crammed with tools and ancient military accessories, flags, photographs, a big trunk, a comfortable-looking armchair, an upright piano and the ever-present bottles of brandy give life to the stage. The feeling of intimacy created by this setting is enhanced by the small number of seats and the frequent incursions of the actor to the stalls.

The piece itself is very intimate: a two-man show in first person, where both actors play the same character at different ages, and constantly dialogue with the audience. Right from the start, Charles Aitken as Billy Bishop brilliantly conquers everyone’s empathy with his joyful portrait of youth and energy. And Oliver Beamish as the older Billy Bishop provides a mature, retrospective analysis of the same stories, while also playing the piano accompaniment for the songs. The pair work seamlessly together, complementing each other’s narratives. Often they play additional roles, giving the action momentum and surprising the audience. I just wished they were better singers, but we can’t have everything. What they lacked in pitch, though, was largely compensated for by performing skills.

Subtle comic references and witty remarks are a constant throughout the whole piece. Lighthearted at first, the humour gets increasingly dark, along with the intensity of the drama. In a remarkable scene, a cabaret performer sings joyfully about several pilots: “Nope, he didn’t survive...”

For a generation who has never experienced war, our approach to it is often unrealistic and naive. For us, like for Billy, sometimes, “It doesn’t seem like war at all”. As such, the show effectively explores the enthusiasm of the young soldier, who volunteers to fight and leaves his native Canada in search of adventure. He later transfers to the aviation branch of the army, a highly sought-after position, to escape the mud and boredom of the trenches. His confrontation with the rude cruelty of death and survival is violent. We accompany him through the dark acceptance of the reality of war and his transformation into a fearless hero, the highest-scoring pilot during World War I.

There are truly enchanting moments throughout the piece. Just to name a few: letters to a longtime fiancée; a priceless conversation in the War Office; the delight of a pilot learning to fly; an action-packed scene of aerial stunting and shooting (yes, in theatre!); the emotional fragility of a human being mourning his friends who “ain’t supposed to die”; an upper class lady’s disgusted remarks on colonials’ manners; and more.

_Billy Bishop Goes to War_ is a powerful tale of humanity. Through laughter, powerful emotions, and brilliant performances, it has all the ingredients for a memorable evening!
