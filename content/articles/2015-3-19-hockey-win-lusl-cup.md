Having won a hard fought battle against RUMS in the semi-final, IC travelled to Royal Holloway to take part in the final of the London Universities Cup against King’s GKT on Saturday. GKT had previously beaten IC in a pre-season friendly in the only meeting of the two teams this season, finishing 2nd in the BUCS league above IC meant that on paper they were surely favourites to take the Cup title. However, coach Cooper had prepared a game plan tailored their style of play and because of this IC were confident in their ability to cause an upset.

The game began at a high tempo with good passing interplay displayed by both teams. Defensively IC were the stronger side, Pollock was able to completely shut down GKT’s useful right back and the rest of GKT’s attacking efforts were like water breaking on rock against the ever sturdy defensive line. IC looked threatening however and about 10 minutes into the game, a searching aerial from Hedgecock managed to find Dittmar high up the pitch. Dittmar threaded the ball through to Pollock at the top of the D who calmly slipped the ball between the keeper’s legs and into the goal.

IC continued to apply pressure in attack. Following one of his signature penetrating dribbles, super-sub Cerulus played a ball through to Breakey in the D. With the keeper charging out to meet the ball, Breakey only had to touch the ball to Dittmar on his left, who passed the ball into the open net.

GKT fought back in the second half and managed to level the score with a rehearsed penalty corner and a flick, their relief did not last long however. A clever pick of the ball by Dittmar from a GKT defender saw a pass through to Breakey at the top of the D. Keen to impress his girlfriend supporting on the side-line, he drilled a reverse stick shot into the bottom left hand corner of the goal. GKT again equalised, but further aggression from IC yielded results, a baseline run from Cerulus gifting Breakey with an easy finish, for 4-3. IC’s final goal was from yet another pinpoint cross by Cerulus to gift Price with an easy tap in.

Sensing that defeat was upon them GKT threw everything they had at the IC defence in the dying moments of the game. GKT scrambled a goal back, but the IC defence refused to be beaten again, with some particularly heroic tackles from Murray helping to retain the 5-4 lead. Thanks to arguably their best game of hockey all season, and some top drawer tactics from Cooper, IC secured a well-deserved win and the LUSL Cup title.
