For a moment there, it looked like everything was coming together. FiveSixEight, despite problems and delays, opened to a lively first night. Everyone - even the engineers - seemed to be having a good time.

However disaster struck as a small avalanche of tiles fell off the front of the bar, providing a lively addition to the opening week’s “mayhem”. The beer cooling system behind the bar had caused the wood to bow, thus dislodging the tiles. The Union have said that they are looking to install insulation to prevent this happening again.

In addition a chair (which costs around £120 each) has been broken. The Union said “they are very strong chairs and general wear and tear is to be expected but in this case they appear to have been broken through severe misuse.” The Union warned that security is in place every night to “ensure that the space is used properly and respected.” Heavy drinkers will be encouraged to use Metric when it opens.
