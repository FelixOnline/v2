     The deal varies every week (Tuesday to Mondays) so make sure you get them before it ends ! <br>If you missed any and would like it to be featured feel free to contact us on innosoc@imperial.ac.uk ! <br>Theatre deals for Les Mis coming up end of this week, limited tickets at 50% off ! ,Look, as much credit as I give to the Innovation Society for at least atempting this, it simply won't work for 2 main reasons: <br> <br>a) The website design and usability is very poor at least <br>b) The deals are, unfortunately, just not good enough. The reason sites like Groupon and LivingSocial manage to work is because they offer SIGNIFICANT discounts (read 60%+ on things that one wouldn't usually think about buying). These deals should be about converting people to products, not making it better for the few that are already going to the restaurants, or buying the stuff. <br> <br>This said, I do see potential for the 'marketplace' aspect of the website. Unfortunately these are fed through external sites and not that relevant to Imperial stude

__So what is ‘iConnect’?__

iConnect is a project started by the Innovation Society. It was initially started as an online marketplace but now we’re launching the “Big Plan” – Group Buying for Imperial College at [iConnectImperial.com](http://iConnectImperial.com). The idea is simple: if there are enough people willing to purchase the same product, it can be much much cheaper. It’s basically the Groupon model. The plan is to maximize students’ and staff’s benefit through providing discounts, while also giving the opportunity for local businesses to reach out to the Imperial community. With student finance getting ever-tighter, we want to help students get the best deal. We also aim to raise awareness and money for the Prince’s Trust charity; all of our profits go to them.

__Tell us more about the Innovation Society.__

The Innovation Society is about fostering innovation within Imperial College through advice from us and relevant contacts within the university. It’s a young society – only three years old. We believe that all Imperial students have the potential to be the next Bill Gates or Steve Jobs, but someone must first stand up and create the atmosphere where students dare to think creatively and turn their ideas into reality. …the process of innovation is painful and risky, but it’s worth trying because we have faith in our students!

__So what sort of deals can I get with iConnect? __

At the moment we’re getting around 20-50% discounts with various businesses, mostly restaurants and cafés around South Ken. For example, we have 33% off Oddonno’s ice cream, 50% off Circle Club membership and other deals with theatres, takeaways and sit-down restaurants. We’re also getting extra money for charity: Kensington Crêperie have agreed to give 25p to the Prince’s Trust for every purchase from Imperial students and staff and the chance to win a meal for two worth £30 – simply quote iConnectImperial.

__How does it work?__

What you do is go to the website and pick a deal. The deals are open for four or five days, so you have time to talk to your mates and decide. Then put down your card details and buy it. If enough people buy the deal, then you get a money-off coupon. If not, you keep your money anyway.

__And this benefits charity?__

All profits go to the [Prince’s Trust](http://www.princes-trust.org.uk/), alongside the donations from Kensington Crêperie. The Trust’s motto is “helping change young lives”, and it helps young people in difficult situations, for example who got into prison for the wrong reasons, to rebuild meaningful lives. So the students get good deals, the businesses get more custom and the Prince’s Trust gets more money to help young people.

__What else does the Innovation Society do? __

We also run an online marketplace on the website which allows you to sell second hand items and search for accommodation from Craigslist and Nestoria. We also regularly enter business and innovation competitions. We entered a ‘Dragon’s Den’ style competition called “Profitunity” where we were in the national final, turning £500 to £2,500 in three months.

__Can students get involved?__

We’re always extremely keen for people to be involved – you can do things from running the website to developing your new ideas. Just email us at innosoc@imperial.ac.uk. I’ve learnt a tremendous amount about running a business and developing ideas from the Innovation Society. I have regular meetings with a business mentor still thanks to Profitunity. One also learns a lot about people and different styles of working. The original President WenQian was more of an ‘ideas man’ and I’m more a problem solver – I learnt both types of person are invaluable. There’s lots of potential for posts of responsibility in the committee too, helping people in turn grow their ideas. All great for the CV and later life.

__What’s next and where’s it going?__

We’re working with Felix to coordinate our marketplace with their new classified page. You can get your ad in two places without messing up the notice boards. We’re also getting loads more amazing deals for staff and students, so keep checking the site – you can save money and contribute to the Price’s Trust at the same time. We want at least 5% of students and staff to benefit from deals, so 1,000 regular users. We also much appreciate any feedback via forum or email to make the site even better.
