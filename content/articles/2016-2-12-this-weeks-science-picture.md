Guerilla Science held their V-Day event last Monday at The Book Club. The night titled ‘An Evening of Lust, Sex and Brains’  aimed at demonstrating how senses and brains react when people meet that special someone. Guests were to undertake several challenges based on scientific findings, all while advertising their arousal, holding up a ‘Turned off’ or ‘Turned on’ card, oh and while blindfolded.

The evening provided guests with a range of challenges centred around different sensory experiences. Challenges such as the hearing and smelling challenges, demonstrated the effect of our senses on mate selection, playing on the effect of a complementary immune system on our smell, or the appeal of a deeper voice to women.

Overall a  fun night, but some googling could have saved guests £20.
