Want to make some treats this year for Halloween? Try your hand at these frightfully delicious chocolate-covered peanut butter spiders. Your friends and family will be screaming with delight after they take their first bite.

Ingredients (for 50 spiders):

2 cups smooth peanut butter

1/2 cup of softened butter

1 tablespoon of vanilla extract

4 cups confectioners’ sugar

24 ounces of semisweet chocolate chips

2 and 1/2 tablespoons of shortening

1 jar of Nutella

6 ounces of white chocolate chips

Other items needed

Mixing bowl

Piping bag with a thin metal tip

Baking sheet

Wax paper

In a mixing bowl, combine peanut butter, vanilla extract and softened butter until beaten into a semi-runny paste. Gradually beat in confectioners’ sugar until thick and smooth. Shape into 3cm balls and place on a wax paper-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate until hardened.

In a microwave, melt the chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons of the shortening. Stir until smooth, and dip the peanut butter balls into the chocolate. Re-place on baking sheet, leaving plenty of space between each ball and refrigerate until firm.

Slightly melt the Nutella in the microwave, and then scoop it into the piping bag. On each ball, pipe out eight spider legs with the Nutella. Clean out piping bag, then melt the white chocolate chips and 1/2 tablespoons of the shortening in a microwave. Stir until smooth and put in piping bag. Using the white chocolate to draw two white eyes on the front of each spider. Refrigerate overnight or until hardened.
