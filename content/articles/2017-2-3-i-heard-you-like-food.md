Have you ever found yourself aroused by the thought of having a cream pie pushed into your face or cracking eggs over someone’s chest? Of course you have. Well, you’re not alone. This fringe phenomenon is called ‘Wet and Messy Fetishism’, often abbreviated to WAM or simply called sploshing. Fans of WAM enjoy the sensation of wet or messy substances being rubbed or poured on their bodies. These can include cream, custard, eggs, milk, beer and non-food substances such as paint, gunge, oil, mud or lotion. People involved in WAM often like to stress that bodily fluids are not included in the list.

I caught up with a guy who’s been into WAM for some time to ask him some questions. (He has asked not to be named so we’ll give him the pseudonym Hamish.)
## When did you first realise you were into this stuff?
I think I first realised it was a turn-on in my mid-teens, I stumbled upon some Japanese game-show porn involving cream pies and then just followed a series of links. It became my go-to wank-fuel for quite a while.
## What was your first real life experience of WAM?
Well I tried some solo stuff shortly after I got into the porn. I had a bit of a shaving foam adventure. I emptied several cans over myself and masturbated in the shower. My first experience, with someone else involved, came a few years later. I met someone online and we poured jelly and baked beans all over each other in the bath.
## Where do you think it stems from psychologically?
From quite an early age I tended to enjoy gunge themed or messy game-shows a fair bit more than my friends and got a bit of an odd feeling watching them, so it seemed to pop up fairly early on in my development. I guess making a mess is a bit of a taboo and a lot of fetishes are based around some kind of rule-breaking. It’s certainly an unconventional kind of experience which, for me, makes it quite exciting. It can also be involved in sub/dom or humiliation dynamics which definitely draws me to it.
## Have you ever had a bad experience with it?
Oh god yes. About two years ago, I was between apartments and so was staying with a friend in his London flat for a while. I was super horny while he was still at work so, knowing that he was into it too and wouldn’t mind, I decided I was going to have a solo session in the bath. I went out to buy some milk, eggs, custard and corn-flour. I mixed a big bowl of corn-flour and water, made up the custard and sat in the tub with everything I’d acquired placed by the side. I had a great time, but by the time I finished, the bath had a three inch layer of mess in it. I had planned to clean up before my host arrived back from work, so I pulled the plug, stood up, and went for the shower tap. No water came out.

A bit puzzled, I climbed out of the bath and started to wonder how I was going to get cleaned up. I grabbed an old looking towel and started to wipe the sludge off my body. That’s when I noticed something coming out from beneath the bath side-panel. Unfortunately my host hadn’t told me that the bath wasn’t yet plumbed in. I took off the side panel to see that the mess had spread all over the untiled floor beneath. He got home about two hours later as I was making a feeble attempt to clean it up. He didn’t actually seem that pissed off and after a few hours we managed to get the bulk of it cleaned up, but I don’t think I’ve ever been so ashamed in my life. I avoided talking to him for about a year after that.
## God, that sounds pretty awful. So, do you have any advice or suggested messy substances for people who might want to try WAM?
Allow for a lot of clean up time. It always takes longer than you think. Doing it in a paddling pool or a plumbed in bath is usually a good idea. As for substances, Corn-flour and water is great fun. It’s a personal preference thing though. If you like gunge and slime, you can try Natrosol or Slube which are made for gunge play. Just make sure you check for allergies before you get in a tub of it!
## . . .
That concluded my interview with Hamish. I was left wondering how many minds shows like ‘Get your Own Back’ and ‘Dick and Dom’ had affected early on in sexual development, or whether these urges were more nature than nurture. Either way, rolling around in a paddling pool filled with gunge does sound like a laugh. Maybe I’ll give it a go.
