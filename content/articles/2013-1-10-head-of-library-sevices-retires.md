[Debby Shorley, the Director of Library Services, has retired](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/administration/library/newssummary/news_17-12-2012-10-19-10).

She arrived at Imperial in 2007 and told Reporter, the College magazine, that she “loved (almost!) every minute of it.” She went on to say that “Different universities have different cultures, and the College has a real indefinable buzz about it”. During her time she has[ campaigned](http://www2.imperial.ac.uk/blog/reporter/2011/01/20/challenging-high-journal-fees/) for [open access to knowledge](http://felixonline.co.uk/?article=808) and says “I am cautiously optimistic about the prospects for more open access provision over the next five years. In 20 years’ time I think the model will be turned on its head – I’m not sure quite how, but the landscape will look very different”.

She said that she will miss the working environment and praised her colleagues saying that she has “learned a lot and watched some very clever people doing things well”. She did admit that she will “appreciate not having to get up at 05:45 in the morning to travel in from Brighton!”. She says that she will now spend more time at her house in Burgundy.
