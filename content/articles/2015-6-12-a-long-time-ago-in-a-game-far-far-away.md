If you love star wars, first person shooters or in fact games in general, you could not have missed the fact that the makers of _Battlefield_, __DICE__ are remaking one of the best First Person Shooters (FPS) game ever.

When the original battlefront and its sequel came out and in my childhood I spent many, many, many hours immersed in these titles. Therefore when it was first announced that there would be finally be a new game, tied in with the new movie (which I am also more than excited to see), I didn’t just board hype train, but bought the whole damn track! Ever since then we have been drip fed news regarding the games development and possible features, and I was getting more and more excited.

However, just last month __EA__ finally decided to come clean about some of the features (or lack thereof when compared with the previous games) that would be included in the game, as well as showing off a teaser trailer. The trailer itself looked amazingly good (and brought about as many feels as the movie trailer did), we saw speeder bikes, AT-ATs, force fields and jetpacks among many other things. The concepts on show looked pretty amazing, and I really hope that the game-play delivers what the trailer promised. While the graphics looked stunning, you have to keep in mind that this was actually all pre-rendered, probably over a couple of days, to make it look so good. So we can assume that it won’t really look that amazingly good, even with the best of PCs. Sadly, most of us don’t have the best PCs around, so you may have to deal with the less beautiful graphics or upgrade to a new rig (I really want to do the latter, but will probably have to accept the former).

In terms of features we have confirmed that there will be 12 playable maps at launch on the planets Hoth, Endor, Tattoine and Sullust. Furthermore, in lieu of actual space battles (yes they won’t be in the game) we will instead have space ships in the ground battles, a lá Hoth from _Battlefront 2_. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that heroes will make a comeback, however at this point only Darth Vader and Boba Fett are confirmed.  However, very sadly, there will won’t a single-player campaign. Especially the lack of a single-player campaign makes me a bit sad. While I do get the move to multiplayer only, the singleplayer in _Battlefront 2_ really had something special and told a really good story! With regards to the space battles, I am not really too fussed. They were kinda cool, but in reality where really repetitive and while they may have worked better in this modern iteration, I don’t think we have lost that much.

One warning that I would give you guys, is don’t preorder. There are no associated bonuses, and given DICE’s track record with releases, I would find no benefit in spending my hard-earned cash so early. Server issues will definitely be a problem, and I think that the day-one patch will probably be a necessity. After all the initial hype has settled down and all the initial bugs are patched, you should be able to decide quite clearly if you can afford this game and/or your computer can handle it!
