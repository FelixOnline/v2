2017 was a year of highs and lows for the music world. In a beige scene dominated by Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran, we were treated to rare glimpses of colour from the likes of LCD Soundsystem, Kendrick Lamar, and Arcade Fire. Some lived up to expectations, some exceeded them, and some sadly did neither (sorry not sorry). 2018 is sure to be another rollercoaster, so let’s take a small look at what’s in store.

> Arctic Monkeys

We don’t really know much about this one yet, but bassist Nicholas O’Malley recently let slip in an interview that some recording has taken place. And it makes sense: _AM_ was 5 years ago now and frontman Alex Turner and his new 70s hair have finally stopped touring with the Last Shadow Puppets. 

> Vampire Weekend

Another one that’s been quiet since 2013. A new LP could be pretty soon though, given it’s supposedly been in the works since January 2016. Oh, and it might be called _Mitsubishi Macchiato_. Interesting. Watch this space.

> Franz Ferdinand

This one is more certain. Out on February 9th, _Always Ascending_ promises a new, dancier sound. And it’s accompanied by a host of shows, including at Brixton’s O2 Academy on February 24th. (Word on the street is that Alt. Music Soc are selling cheap tickets tomorrow, but you didn’t hear it from me). 

> Grimes

Back in the summer Claire Boucher teased that she was hitting the studio every day, working on a follow up to 2015’s _Art Angels_. Far from the sun-kissed twinkle pop of the last album though, she’s promised “chill vibes, downtempo, synth-y shit.” Well, I for one am excited.

> Courtney Barnett

It was only three months ago that we had our most recent dose of this Australian chill-rocker, when she teamed up with long-haired layabout Kurt Vile on _Lotta Sea Lice_. But she’s itching to go again, with a new solo album already close to completion, lacking only a title. Thinking of one is certainly a lot of pressure you’ve got _Sometimes I Sit and Think and Sometimes I Just Sit_ to live up to.

> Frank Ocean

“5 albums before 30” he declared in 2012. Well, as of October 28th, that ship has well and truly sailed. However, Ocean recently teased on Tumblr “Well I made the album before 30, I JUST AINT PUT THAT BITCH OUT!” and with his reputation of not releasing things when he says he will and then suddenly dropping two albums at once with no warning, anything is possible.

> David Byrne

A frequent collaborator with the likes of Brian Eno and St. Vincent, it’s been 14 years since the Talking Heads frontman put out a solo album. Always one to buck the trend, the non-ironically named _American Utopia_ is reportedly full of optimism and positivity. Well, we look forward to that ray of sunshine bursting through our blackout curtains in early March.
