After launching in 2003, MySpace was guilty of taking many of our social networking virginities by taking advantage of us being embarrassing teenagers while we posed, pouting in front of mirrors with a 1MP camera phone.

But then we grew up and most of us realised that editing our profile HTML to make people who viewed our profile see our “creativite personality” was super lame, so we moved onto university-based Facebook.

MySpace continued to grow for a few years after Rupert Murdoch (that old dude who owns all the world’s media) purchased it for $580million as it became “the most visited website in the US”, beating Google, in 2006. But from 2008 onwards the site went into an impressively steep decline, with most of us retrospectively deleting our accounts (or wishing we could but we’ve forgot the password for our cringe e-mail “hot\_sexy\_jasonp\_1991@hotmail.com”).

But, last week the cooler of the two Justins, Justin Timberlake, tweeted a link to a video from the former social networking powerhouse entitled “new MySpace”. JT appears to be the front man for the launch of the new Metro-style “redesigned entirely from scratch” social network, and it makes sense as he has an ownership stake in the company.
> it does look significantly cooler and better than Facebook or Google+, and follows a design that is perfectly suited for a Windows 8 app.
After watching it, it does look significantly cooler and better than Facebook or Google+, and follows a design that is perfectly suited for a Windows 8 app. I’m kind of looking forward to it.

But, whatever happens, I can’t wait for Bebo to get a revamp. The couple who created it went to Imperial, met in the then Southside bar, and got married before selling it for $850m. I mean, can you believe it, he found a girl at Imperial!
