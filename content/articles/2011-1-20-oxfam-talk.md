Want to learn a little more about the issues affecting international development in an ever-changing world?

On Tuesday 25th January, Duncan Green, the Head of Research at Oxfam UK, will be giving a talk at Imperial College in Chem Eng. LT1 at 6pm, hosted by Engineers Without Borders Imperial.

This April sees the launch of a new Oxfam global campaign entitled ëFood justice in a resource constrained worldí.

Duncan will be promoting this new campaign and Imperial students are invited to come and listen to the talk and join in the discussion afterwards. Debate is welcome about where international development is headed in the near future as well as the problems faced by both developing countries themselves and organisations such as Oxfam.

Having learned about the impact of politics in poverty stricken nations whilst working as a journalist in South America, Duncan has been researching and writing about those less well off for nearly 30 years. Nowadays, as well as working on research for Oxfam, he has recently written the book ëFrom Poverty to Powerí. This collaborative text gets a 21st century perspective on the issue of inequality in poorer countries. The book aims to promote realistic solutions to restoring the balance of power for the average family from a political and economic standpoint.

This talk is a great opportunity for anyone interested in development to learn about the current global situation and how we may help to establish a world of equal opportunity from an expert in the field.

Also on the 8th February at 6pm, the Global Poverty Project (GPP) will be presenting their ë1.4 Billion Reasonsí presentation. Founded by a team from the ëMake Poverty Historyí campaign, the presentation aims to encourage small changes in our daily lifestyle to help alleviate extreme poverty.
