 - I think this is perhaps the worst Felix article I have ever read You do not even try to present a serious argument relying instead on trite oneliners and hysterical florid prose Explain how exactly famine is a consequence of capitalism given the Soviet famine of 3233 the Chinese famine of 5961 or the North Korean famine of 9498 all of which occurred in Socialist states How exactly did we build poverty ourselves when the number of people in poverty is currently lower than its ever been Or do you think the average person in 1016 or 1515 was better off than they are nowAnd how exactly is it unnatural for humans to eat meat when we have specific biological adaptations to enable us to do so Take a look in the mirror and think about what a terrible article youve written and while youre doing that take a look at the natural shape of your teeth Grace I am disappointed I welcome people expressing controversial opinions but in articles that are wellresearched logically consist

No. If you guessed by reading the title that I was going to say warfare, you are wrong. Poverty? We built that ourselves. Famine? Yet another consequence of capitalism. The Holocaust? Although a stigma that will forever stain the history of mankind, it did not sustain itself for relatively long. Inquisition? Read the previous. What about, say, the food industry? And moreover, the carnivorous food industry?

Yes, that’s right: mass-slaughter of animals. As much as meat eaters may use the excuse, “Oh no, but we are higher up the food chain and some animals eat others as means of feeding” as an argument, this is an altogether fallacious one. You see, we as humans should have – and in fact it is this very capability that supposedly distinguishes us from the rest of faunal species – intelligence.

Intelligence allows us to discern the good from bad, the right from wrong, happy from sad, and ultimately have mercy – or at least pity – for those in pain. Indeed, it is natural for animals to eat other animals but since when did it become natural to inhibit millions of animals from having their freedom by confining them in cells awaiting their unquestioned demise?

Pigs are desperately squealing, cows violently writhing, chicken being forced to lay unnatural amounts of eggs, ducks having a stick jammed in their throats and still there are a handful of shareholders profiting from it. And it is from death that they profit. Insofar as laws concern, this is legal under every constitution even despite how many non-governmental organisations and activist groups lobby against it. It may well be legal, but essentially lacks the most basic of ethics: humanity. Ah, but when it comes to a cute puppy everyone feels empathy and is softened just by looking at a photoshopped picture.

Sadly, there is no stopping this force given that it has gained too much inertia by today. Meat is now  a staple in everyone’s diet and is even entrained within different cultures. By opting to be a vegetarian, one’s conscience may remain clean but this does not stop the ruthless consumerism of the society as a whole. Perhaps a good way to part-solve the problem would be to, at the very least, let these animals live in a somewhat “natural” environment and use less violent methods (some sort of short life drug) to butcher them. And of course, decrease the volume of the overall industry by a great deal.
