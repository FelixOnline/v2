title: Jesus Hopped the ‘A’ Train
subtitle: >-
  Set in the high security wing of Rikers Island, Jesus Hopped the ‘A’ Train
  boldly contrasts the stories of two inmates and the circumstances that led
  them there. On one hand, we have new prisoner Angel Cruz, played by Ukweli
  Roach, who shot a religious cult leader “in the ass” for brainwashing his
  friend – he’s frightened, confused, and doesn’t really know where he stands or
  what’s going to happen to him. On the other hand, there’s veteran inmate
  Lucius Jenkins, played by Oberon K. A. Adjepong, a serial killer who endures
  life on death row by God-fearing preaching and unreciprocated philosophical
  discourse with sadistic, no-nonsense guard Valdez. The dialogue goes from
  sharp and witty to deep debates fluently, and the men argue about forgiveness,
  faith, redemption, responsibility, and crime. The delivery was spot on, from
  Adjepong’s powerful performance as almost-too-righteous and aggressively
  committed to his cause, to Roach as superficially cocky but in reality
  terrified. There’s also fine work by both Joplin Sibtain and Dervla Kirwan,
  who play the archetypal callous warden and arrogant defence lawyer
  respectively. The set itself, expertly designed by Magda Willi, was evocative
  – a catwalk-type stage running through the middle with seating on either side,
  and perpendicular sliding glass doors to signify the divisions between jail
  cells. Young Vic plays are always interestingly staged, but this design lent
  itself particularly well to the context. Aside from the ‘jail cells’ and a
  chair, there is nothing else – it is totally bare, with no clutter, both
  exposing the characters symbolically, and also allowing their emotion and
  acting to do all the talking, so the audience can really appreciate it. It is
  interesting to see when the doors move together and apart from each other,
  they are representing the compression and decompression physically, mirroring
  the character arcs. The dense writing really thrives here, and as Willi says
  in an interview, they didn’t need much décor to make it work. The sound design
  starts off slightly abrasive, with the cacophony of trumpets with lights out
  during scene changes,but you get used to it. In short, the play is addressing
  important questions of facing up to your wrongdoings and holding yourself
  accountable, and whether redemption is ever possible, which I’m sure everyone
  can relate to (just maybe not on a scale this extreme). There are no easy
  answers, and whilst you won’t leave the theatre knowing exactly what the
  message of the play was meant to be, it provides a lot of food for thought –
  and really, what more could you ask for?
