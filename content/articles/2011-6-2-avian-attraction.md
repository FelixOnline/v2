     I agree with Eve. I was very interested and will no doubt cionsder wheat-free diet when in the US. However the final diet exposed in the WheatBelly sounded like the Aikens diet- high fat,very low carbs and high protein. As a vegetarian concerned out getting the right amount of B vitamins (without using supplements) and minerals diet Dr. Davis recommends would not work for me. But thanks for all the info. I have begun researching and will pass on to others.,Hi James,The grand traverse would be a <a href="http://equyaoh.com">siiilmar</a> difficulty to a half marathon, with the hills making up for the shorter distance. Competitors usually complete the event in a similar time to a half, maybe slightly longer if minimal hill training has been done. Most of the steeper hills are between the 3rd and 9th km, after which it is primarily downhill/undulating. Many runners walk parts of the steeper hill sections and save the legs for running along the tops and downhill. Last year I walked most of the uphill climb to

When it comes to choosing a mate, female sparrows have shown they’re anything but bird-brained. According to new research, the feathered females don’t simply pick the most physically attractive, but instead assess the quality of their potential suitor’s inner values.

It all comes down to a cluster of genes that play a role in immunity, called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Researchers from the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna examined preferences for partners in house sparrows by offering a female sparrow a choice of three different males. They found females with a low number of MHC alleles were most attracted to males carrying a high number of such alleles, suggesting females can “count” the number of MHC alleles on offer from individual males. The evidence is the first to suggest birds’ mating preferences are influenced by the MHC.
