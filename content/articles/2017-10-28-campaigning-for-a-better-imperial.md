Earlier this year when I ran to become your Campaigns Officer, I spoke about the ways in which previous campaigns have changed the very fabric of the Imperial that we know and love. I referenced the way in which we lobbied for quality affordable accommodation for all our students, and for free universal healthcare coverage for our international student community – success or failure, over the years there have been many excellent campaigns that have had a profound impact on our university experience.

What I did not highlight in great detail was the scope for improvement at Imperial – improvement that only effectively-run campaigns can deliver for the student body. It is my hope that the rapidly-changing campus culture, partly driven by changes in senior College and Union leadership, will sustain a drive towards more active engagement with campaigns from a greater cross-section of the entire student body. My priority this year is to support the student body to not only initiate campaigns, but to follow-through and successfully execute them in a meaningful way, beneficial to the organisers – in a personal and professional manner – and the wider community. To provide a case study of what we want to achieve: this year, others and I will be pushing forward the Sleep Imperial campaign, which aims to enhance student health, productivity, and satisfaction.

We can look forward to what I believe will be an exciting year for campaigns. The difference that we can make as a collective is on a scale that, individually, we can only dream of.
