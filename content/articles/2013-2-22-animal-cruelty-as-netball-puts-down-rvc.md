     wed at the Columbia in Ybor City, FL. I photographed their engamegent session last fall (see it here) and made the awful sin of scheduling it during a Bucs game. Needless to say, these huge fans,Update- Since the Vikings won the formula to<a href="http://dexcdnem.com"> gtinteg</a> into the playoffs for the Birds is clear. One wildcard will definitely fall to Tampa or Carolina with the other winning their division(NFC Sounth). All of the remaining wild card contenders would need to have 6 losses and the Birds could get in if they run the table at 10-5-1. The problem is that means the Cowgirls and Atlanta would both need to lose 2 out of their remaining 4 games. The rest of the contenders will surely have 6 losses. All that and the birds have to win 4 straight. The perfect storm would have to occur for the Eagles to have any shot. If we had only beaten Cincinnati this would be much easier. Watching the Ravens take apart the Bengals today reminds me just how pathetic the Eagles tie was.

Previously in the season, IC 1’s ventured to muddy Hertfordshire with some usual players missing and some turning up hungover to take on RVC 1’s in the BUCs league, so understandably we suffered an unfortunate loss. However, with 2 more chances to play them, we were determined to show them what we’re made of.

This Monday, our first chance came- a LUSL match in our home turf of Ethos. With every player intact (except WA Kirsty who managed to break her shoulder at the beginning of the season...) we were ready for a win. The first quarter started badly, with a quick turnover from RVC 1’s they scored 4 goals in succession before we had scored any! Their GS in particular surprised us with her quick movement and superb aim. However, this made us yet more determined and with some of the best play we’ve seen through the centre court we quickly pulled back into the lead. Our shooter Tamar showed she was equally capable of scoring from anywhere in the D with shot after shot going in, (this is a girl who once showed up slightly drunk to a match and was still able to shoot perfectly – albeit sometimes her catching wasn’t quite as on form). By the end of the first quarter we had a lead of 14-8, extending 10 goals ahead of their 0-4 lead.

It seemed GK Sophie had the hardest job to do with their shooter easily being their stand out player. Using her height to our advantage, Sophie pressured RVC into doing loopier passes that often the GS couldn’t even reach. Furthermore, Sophie’s blocking skills are superb meaning the RVC GS occasionally tried to shove Sophie out of the way which luckily the umpires saw and called contact. On the other side of the court, WA Nancy, GA Poppy and Centre Sam were perfecting their centre passes. With Nancy only joining the 1’s just before Christmas, this has been a difficult area in recent games. However, on Monday something just clicked and they began working seamlessly together, easily getting the ball into the D and scoring within 3 or 4 passes. Of course, nothing ever works perfectly all the time, and the odd pass into GS Tamar went a bit astray, with one sending her flying back onto her bum.

In the final quarter, we intended to neaten our game, as against a better team every mistake would probably cost us a goal. We saw fast turnovers as WD Tereze and GD Verity came out of nowhere to steal the ball from under their noses. Verity just seems to have endless energy when she plays, leaping across the court to intercept passes. Due to some contact from RVC’s WD, Nancy managed to get ‘Netball finger’ due to the ball pelting the tips of her fingers at full speed, causing a fair amount of pain. Luckily Claude, who usually plays WD/GD, was able to quickly come on to play WA. Considering she rarely plays attack, Claude showed her versatility as she fit in well and by the end of the game the score was 61-39.

IC 1’s position in the LUSL league only goes to show that they should be in a higher BUCs league. Currently 4th in LUSL, below Medics 1’s (1 league above in BUCS) and Kings medics 1’s (2 leagues above in BUCS) and above plenty of teams that are in higher BUCs leagues too. Unfortunately, due to some undeserving losses the 1’s are looking at finishing second this year in the BUCs tables but with most of the team returning next year, we’re looking up. Roll on varsity...
