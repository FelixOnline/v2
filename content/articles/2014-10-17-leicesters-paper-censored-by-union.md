Controversy has broken out at the University of Leicester over an attempt to censure its student paper, The Ripple, by the students’ union at Leicester. In an editorial posted on the paper’s website, Editor in Chief Jess Buckley expressed her disappointment with the Leicester union’s decision to hold back publication by 72 hours whilst the executive committee determined if a story on the front page violated a number of rules. Unlike at Imperial, media groups at Leicester are required to have their output approved by the Union prior to publication or broadcast following the introduction of a “Media Constitution” . The article in question related to criticisms of the ongoing elections at the university, asking whether “there is a lack of engagement”. According to the Ripple, the union accused the paper of writing a number of inaccuracies and violating the constitution. Upon probing as to what exactly the offending text was, no concrete answer was provided.

The issue was then ultimately authorised for publication with no changes 72 hours after being first sent in for authorisation. According to rules at the union, a media publication or broadcast can only be pulled if it contains content which is illegal, libellous, or unconstitutional. Where a student paper is not its own distinct legal entity (both Felix and the Ripple fall into this category), legal challenges against the first two points would fall to the union’s trustees and not the paper; whereas constitutional matters are a purely internal affair.

The requirement for authorisation could be seen as an attempt for the Union to ‘cover its own back’. Students have reacted angrily to the attempt to censure the paper. On the Ripple’s website, one reader complained against the “draconian” nature of union authorisation for articles; arguing “no wonder The Tab is so popular”. A group have students have now started a campaign for a referendum to prevent the union from banning publication.
