Last year was great and we are trying to achieve even more in the coming year! We had 29 members, more than enough to put fantastic routines together!! Only a few months on and our members – beginners, intermediates and advanced – were presenting their routines at our Christmas show in the pool of St. Mary’s hospital. This name is probably familiar to everyone given that the Royal Baby was born there. That’s also where our training sessions take place. So, if you join our team, you will see the famous hospital.

Add a Harlington grant, some pretty good RCC funding and a Sport Imperial sponsorship and you get some great new equipment, to make sure you get fit and your muscles are toned, and an amazing professional coach, to get the best teaching ever, whatever your level!

Last May, six of our members, half of them beginners, competed in the French National University Championship; and just like the year before, are now happily wearing their bronze medals. More than a competition, this was an opportunity for a great weekend of Synchro and other activities all together in Bordeaux! We visited the French city, and discovered a vineyard as well as a Mexican Navy Boat. We also spent a couple of days by the sea to do some open water training and try fresh seafood. We don’t know yet where the competition will take place this year, but we’ll be there and you can be part of it!
 Not everyone wants to commit to that much training. But everybody will get the chance to present what he or she has learned. Last summer’s show with the teams from Brighton and London Seymour was very successful, attracting over 60 visitors at Ethos pool. All our members were able to show their skills and were astonished to see what Synchro elite and master swimmers can do; and The Brighton Dolphins convinced everyone that Synchro can still be enjoyed after 50! Join us this year and you will be a part of it. You will also be able to go to Brighton and swim with the Brighton Dolphins, enjoy a walk on the beach, a nice, fresh portion of fish and chips, and discover the very famous Brighton pubs!
 Of course Synchro is not just about swimming; it’s also being part of a super friendly team, with swimmers of all nationalities, having a great time in various pubs and restaurants and trying things you haven’t tried before! You won’t be getting fit alone in your gym but having a lot of fun in the pool with good music and nice people, and we can promise you will get fitter than you would have by watching a wall and running on a treadmill!!

But Synchro does not only help you to get in shape, joining the team is also a way to boost your CV. Our committee is currently run by final year PhD students, so there will be three open positions very soon, if you want a fun way to learn essential life skills this is the place to start! Last year our Club Chair received the RCC Merit Award and was nominated as Sports Ambassador of the Year.

IC Synchro can only be successful with members, so we need you! We hope to have convinced you that our club offers a great variety of activities.
