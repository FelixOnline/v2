__What do you do?__

I’m a self-funded PhD student from Russia. I am investigating the effect of synaptic proteins on neural circuits. I was a BioChem undergraduate at Imperial and let me say this, Dr Jane Saffell and Prof. Yuri Ushkaryov’s final year modules are irreplaceable. Their teaching was fantastic and I bet Jane knows the name of every student in her classes.

__What stage of your PhD are you at?__

I technically started in September in the division of Cell and Molecular Biology but actually I started in January at the former Institute of Biomedical Engineering (IBE) which shut down over the summer. My supervisor there went to Newcastle but I couldn’t follow him so therefore I changed supervisor to Prof. Yuri Ushkaryov.

__So you will have to change supervisor for a 2nd time less than a year into your PhD?__

Yes. When I started with Yuri I was aware of the restructuring but I was constantly re-assured that my research would fit into the new department and that my supervisor also fits but strangely now it seems that’s not the case.

__What are your options?__

Well officially, there’s nothing happening until January and then I’ll have until July to do, whatever, who knows. There’s no-one else in the U.K. who has the necessary expertise to supervise my PhD effectively. I have to find a supervisor who is willing to experiment. Yuri was the only person after the move from the IBE who was willing to help me to do the research that I want to do. I’m paying money for this, I don’t want to do a different area of research. I want to do the research that I’m interested in. If Yuri finds a position elsewhere I would go with him. Not only because of the expertise but also because I am getting tired of the way Imperial College is treating its staff and students.

__How do you feel about the process?__

I just got an email saying that some people had been affected. I didn’t even know that my supervisor was affected, I first heard through word of mouth. This is the 2nd time that this has happened. I really don’t know if I’m going to stay at Imperial now...
