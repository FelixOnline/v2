Ingredients

1 cup flour
 1 cup semolina
 1 cup sugar
 1 cup coconut
 1 cup milk
 6 tbsp ground flaxseed 1 1/5 cup water
 3 tsp baking powder 1/6 cup vanilla extract 1 cup oil
 For the syrup:
 1 cup sugar
 1 cup water
 1⁄2 tsp lemon

Procedure
 Lightly grease a 9-inch cake pan and preheat the oven to 180 degrees. Make the syrup by boiling the sugar and water for about 7-8 minutes. Remove from heat, add the lemon and let it cool.
 In a cup mix the flaxseed with the water and set aside. In a bowl mix all the dry ingredients and in a separate bowl mix all the wet ingredients (including the flaxseed mixture). Now mix wet and dry ingredients until they have just combined. Do not overmix. Bake until you insert a toothpick in the centre which comes out clean. Right after you remove the cake from the oven, pour the cold syrup on it and then sprinkle some more coconut.
