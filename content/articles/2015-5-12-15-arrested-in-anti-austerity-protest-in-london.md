Protestors threw traffic cones, smoke bombs and other objects at the police in central London, angry that the Conservatives won the general election.

Thousands gathered in the impromptu protests, where Officers in riot gear clashed with a "minority" of protesters who were demonstrating against further austerity cuts to public services. The police described the protest as an “unplanned” demonstration.

A police investigation is also under way after the phrase "Fuck Tory Scum” was graffitied onto the Women’s War Memorial in Whitehall. This comes just as the Queen attended a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey to mark the 70th anniversary of VE Day - the end of World War Two in Europe.

"Fuck Tory Scum" was graffitied onto the Women's War Memorial -

A Downing Street spokesman condemned the graffiti as "a despicable display of disrespect for those who fought and died for their country".

In a statement, the Met said 12 people were arrested on suspicion of violent disorder and three for assault on police. Of the 15 arrested, 14 have been bailed pending further enquiries including a full review of CCTV footage and a 24-year-old man remains in custody after being arrested on suspicion of assault on police.

Two officers were treated at hospital after the clash with protestors, while three other officers were assaulted but did not go to hospital. There have been no reported injuries to any protesters.

Chief Superintendent Gerry Campbell said the "vast majority" of protestors had taken part peacefully, but added that a "small minority" had been intent on causing disorder.

"We have launched an investigation into criminal damage to the Women in World War Two Memorial. This is particularly abhorrent considering we are celebrating the 70th anniversary of VE Day," he said.

A similar, albeit smaller, rally against austerity took place in Cardiff over the weekend. Roughly 200 people were protesting, including the singer Charlotte Church.
