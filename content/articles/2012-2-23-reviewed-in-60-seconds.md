__David Bowie - _The Rise And Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars___

Having been released 40 years ago, this review is probably a bit late. For those of you who are less than familiar with the work of __David Bowie__ this album is a great place to start.

_The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars _is about the human-like alien, Ziggy Stardust, sent to earth to bring humanity hope in the last five years of its existence. This is one of the shortest and most accessible of David Bowie’s albums, and in my opinion his best. It is full of cracking pop/glam-rock songs, some of which you will be more than familiar with, all of which will leave you keen to press repeat.

Rating: 4/5

__Venetian Snares - _Cubist Reggae___

Usually, listening to __Snares__ would be a great way to burn calories through hearing. This time around, Aaron Funk stretches time out into a groove, letting shine through all the intricacies so deeply ingrained in his work. The result gives the sensation of atmospheric electrocution in slow motion.

The title sums it up: a kaleidoscopic take on an otherwise somewhat monotonously upbeat genre. Less expected are the orchestral samples interspered between percussive jabs akin to sticking a knife in a toaster.

The aural equivalent of realising that the paracetamol you took to help you sleep contained a significant amount of caffeine.

__Hollie Cook - _Hollie Cook___

Last June saw the release of __Hollie Cook__’s self-titled debut album. Unfortunately it passed me by at the time – the wonderful lilting reggae rhythms would have been the perfect accompaniment to summer.

Many parallels can be drawn with __Lily Allen__; both are London-based daughters of famous musicians (even if Keith Allen is better known for his acting) and both make their own, individual brand of pop music. Despite this, there are large differences in their output; Cook’s vocals more dreamy, floating effortlessly over catchy reggae hooks. It may still be gray outside but this album is one sure to convince you that summer is only just around the corner.

Rating: 3/5
