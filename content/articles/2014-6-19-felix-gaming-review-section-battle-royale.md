#### Felix News

The games editorial team can now exclusively reveal that the Felix news section would be much better if there was a heavier focus on gaming news. Recent articles in the game section garnered a lot of views, and there were several calls for the current games editor to be instated as news editor. In fact, the current Editor-in-Chief remarked: “I really like gaming, gaming is fun.”, which seems to suggest he supports the idea of a change at the helm of the front page of Imperial’s newspaper. There seems to also be suggestions of a redesign of the felix logo as seen on the right, with a public poll to take place to choose the right one.

#### Felix Comment

The discussion for this article is whether the comment section would be better with a heavier focus on gaming. While currently the comment section is quite boring, discussing inane topics like philosophy and communism, a larger influence from the interesting area of gaming would certainly increase readership in this old-fashioned section. In fact, the current Editor-in-Chief remarked: “I really like gaming, gaming is fun.”, once again suggesting a shake up in the current set up of the comment section. I myself would be quite satisfied if this happened, and would certainly contribute.

#### Felix Science

A recent scientific paper published in the prestigious journal Gamure that suggests that the science section is boring, and would be much better if gaming was given a more prominent position. This could include the science of how shooting barrels and/or respawns. This last issue in particular has wide-ranging consequences and could result in immortality. In fact, the current Editor-in-Chief remarked: “I really like gaming, gaming is fun.”, suggesting he as well is inclined to introduce a gaming focus into science, thus making this section more relevant for the Imperial college of Science an Technology.

#### Felix Arts

Having recently visited the gaming exhibition at earls court, including modern artists like EA van Gogh and Leonardo Di Activision, has really opened my eyes to gaming as an art form. The pieces like Call of Duty were insightful and really commented on our current social and economical situation. I, therefore, call for the Felix Editor who recently said, “I really like gaming, gaming is fun.” to shake up the dusty art section and actual get people reading it. This change could include instating the games editor as arts editor, as well as featuring interesting art (gaming) reviews.

#### Felix Music

The latest album GTA V by genre-spanning rockstars Rockstar studios has been an absolute success. The music throughout the entirety of this work really is entertaining and spans the entire spectrum of emotion. It allows you to let your anger free and really roam the wide world it creates. Now read again, you read a gaming review. Admit it, you loved it. Therefore I suggest that we model music more on the gaming section, with a heavier focus on gaming. This idea is also supported by the current editor-in-chief who said: “I really like gaming, gaming is fun.”

#### Felix Film

This lengthy section, almost like the films it review, would certainly benefit from a snappier first person gaming approach. Controlling the characters would convey emotion and thus giving this section a much needed readership boost. In addition the Felix editor himself said: “I really like gaming, gaming is fun.”

#### Felix Tech

The tech section is the worst section of them all. Maximilian Eggl, current technology section editor said: “It’s completely shit, we only review apple stuff anyway.” Us from the gaming section have no clear solution for this lack of quality due to the fact that even doing more gaming related material would not increase the quality of this section. What we do suggest is scrapping the tech section completely and introducing a section namely gaming-technology, with Maximilian Eggl, current gaming section editor, as its chief.

#### Felix Food

Sandwich à la Gaming:

2 x pieces of bread

1 x piece of ham

2 x salad leaves

3 x tomatoes

Mayonaise

Firstly toast the bread until it is crunchy, and then slowly add the mayonaise to each side. Next very carefully cut the tomatoes into halves and arrange them symmetrically on one of the pieces of toast. Then forcefully throw the salad on the toast, and finish off with slapping the ham on, and then smacking the two pieces together. Voilà you know have perfect gaming snack food

#### Felix Books

The books section while rather entertaining, when reviewing the walk through guides of various games (which it does too rarely), still lacks that heavy gaming influence that for instance the gaming section possesses. The editor-in-chief himself remarked: “I really like gaming, gaming is fun.” Which completely supports the idea that he wants to revamp the books section, and rename it to the Walkthrough Books section, furthermore giving the already overworked games section team (who were incredibly successful) the job of increase the readership.

#### Felix Sports

Last week the Felix Sports Sabrecats came up against the Gaming Giants. After failing to score a single point, the Sabrecats were ruthlessly destroyed when the Giant’s Skene entered the fray. Furthermore a dismal display by Sabrecat’s captain Wagle just went to show that the Giants were superior to the Sabrecats. After this humiliating loss owner of both franchises, Editor-in-chief Joe Letts said that “I really like gaming, gaming is fun.”, thereby sacking the entire Sabrecats players, and instating the Giants team as a dual team taking over the roles of both.

#### Felix Catnip

Lonely catnip editor looking for a games editor to make her section better. He must be creative with design, have a heavy focus on gaming, and be able to write good articles in a pinch. I, myself, am in charge of a rather unknown section trying to get more exposure and readers. Starting out with a co-editorship with a possible move into senior editorship possible (winky face). Editor-in-chief himself said, “I really like gaming, gaming is fun”, meaning he is more than happy to finally get this section off the ground, and actually getting people to meet up.

#### Felix Hangman

Hey hangman editor here. I have managed to change the games editors review of my section before it went to print. They said that hangman would be better if it made fun of gaming. No effing way. Gaming section is the worst section, and I would rather wipe read bad poetry than set my eyes upon that tripe. In fact, you know what, gaming could do with a bit more hangman. So from next year onwards the gaming section will now be known as the gameman section, horoscopes, bad jokes and being really unfunny, just like the real hangman section! In fact, the Felix editor himself said, “I really like hangman, hangman is fun.”
