You know [those music writers who twist meaningless metaphor around meaningless metaphor](http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Mark+Pytlik) in a futile attempt to recreate the music on paper? Wander/Wonder is basically that kind of reviewer’s wet dream. But it also a bear-trap for anyone who thinks they’re going to slide along without using the word “arrangements” – dammit Pitchfork, wtf does that even mean?!? So I’m going to try my best not to fall into douchebaggery and be completely straightforward about this intensely beautiful album.

__Balam Acab__ (Harry Potter spell? Really nasty skin problem? Name of a Somali Pirate King?) is a 20-year-old producer who’s managed to express himself emotionally in more ways than I’ll be able to when I have grandchildren. Alec Koone’s music is 100% abstract electronica; he floats somewhere between instrumental hip-hop producers like __Clams Casino__ and the R&B-infused rhythms of __How to Dress Well__. (As you might expect from most ‘intelligent’ electronic music, his songs are awash with stretched out, ethereal vocals.)

All right, I can’t hold it any longer; I’m bringing in the over-extended metaphors. If __Bon Iver’s___For Emma, Forever Ago_ brought with it the sounds of a lonely log-cabin, Balam Acab takes you to a dark secluded cave and tells you not to come back until you’ve gazed at the stars, stubbornly resisted the morning sunlight, and thoroughly indulged every nostalgic fibre in your body.

_If you know what Pitchfork writers are talking about when they say “arrangements”, tweet me [@kadhimshubber](https://twitter.com/#!/kadhimshubber). If you’re similarly dumbfounded, tweet something irritating and boorish [@pitchforkmedia](https://twitter.com/#!/pitchforkmedia). Better still, tweet [@thebalamacab](https://twitter.com/#!/thebalamacab) and say “thanks for the sweet album, bro!”_
