__[Paladog](http://armorgames.com/play/13262/paladog)__

The evil of mankind was too much, and the Gods decided to replace us with a bunch of small sentient animals. A millenium later, bored demons attack, and the only warrior around is a West Highland Terrier on a horse. Makes sense.

You are Paladog, a noble warrior who can wield magic and summon an army of critters to fight with him. Earn gold and experience, upgrade and take the fight back to the demons. Cute, colourful and excruciatingly addicting.

[__Starlight 2__](http://armorgames.com/play/5542/starlight-2)

Something less stressful to ease exam and project tension? _Starlight 2_’s your game.

It’s an ingenious concept – you’re given a seemingly random constellation, and it’s your job to rotate and twist them around until you form a recognizable shape or object. The easier levels require just a little twisting, whilst the harder ones demand more thought. A thoroughly relaxing and original game through and through.

__[Orange Roulette](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/596354)__

“_They’ve squeezed us all dry. Now they promise to ship me out... After I play a little game..._” Sentient oranges and Russian roulette don’t usually go hand in hand, but they do now. You are an orange, waiting to be shipped out. Just time for one more game...

For a simple random chance game _Orange Roulette_ is both eerily creepy and tense. Do you spin the chamber, aim at your opponent – or put the barrel to your own zesty temple and pull?

[__Phage Wars 2__](http://armorgames.com/play/4013/phage-wars-2)

Biology! Despite the fact that _Phage Wars_ doesn’t actually contain any true phages (viruses that attack bacteria, don’t you know?) it’s still pretty fun. Infect other cells, and use them to launch an attack against rival amoebae (or whatever the hell they are).

Use ‘gene upgrades’ to splice up your cell and make them faster, stronger and more deadly. Genetic recombination has never been so simple!

[__Achievement Unlocked 3__](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/596370)

Most games have achievements, but then again most don’t give them out for pausing the game or offering food to a giant guinea pig king stuck in a hamster tube.

_Achievement Unlocked 3_ is for the underachievers amongst us – you get about 10 achievements for simply starting the game and moving. Slowly they get harder and harder to earn, and soon even achievement farmers will be scratching their heads. A cool time waster.

[__Infectonator 2__](http://armorgames.com/play/13150/infectonator-2)

Ever dreamed of becoming the next H5N1 virus? Me neither, but _Infectonator 2_ is still worth your time.

You start up your global reign of terror with something that could be outcompeted by the common cold. Start to infect people, upgrade your virus to be faster, more virulent and overall more badass, and soon you’ll make Spanish Flu look like a small blip. Keep an eye on the time – this game can be a massive time sink!

[__Clockwork__](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/591142)

Puzzle games like _Clockwork_ aren’t usually my thing, but it reminded me too much of old childhood block puzzles.

Twist and turn rotating blocks around their paths, blocking them off to create a clear path for your sunbeam in the middle to escape from. Things can get messy if you let them circle around freely, so a certain amount of logical thinking is required. You must ask yourself one question: __ARE YOU MAN ENOUGH?__

[__/ESCAPE\__](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/587905)

_/ESCAPE\ _is one of those games that’s easy to pick up but (moderately) difficult to master. The controls are simple – Escape is the only key you press, and the whole point of the game is to escape a pit lined with electrical traps.

Execution is a little harder though – there’s a laser on your tail, so slow down too much as you’ll get fried. Mistime a jump, get fried. Play these Flash games too much during revision? Get fried (but not literally).
