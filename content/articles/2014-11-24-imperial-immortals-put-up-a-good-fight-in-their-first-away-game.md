Sunday 16th November brought the Imperial Immortalsâ€™ first away game of the season against the Hertfordshire Hurricanes. The Hurricanes are an impressive team that made the semi-finals last season, the same as the Immortals. This was an important match for both teams as the Immortals were looking to extend their season to 2-0 while Hurricanes wanted their first win of the season.

The Immortals started on defence, where they started strong causing a forced fumble that was recovered by Imperial to put on the offence. The offence came up against arguably the second best defence in the country, who were on form for sure. The offense struggled in the first half but the defence came through and limited Herts to 19, making some huge goal line stops to stuff the high powered Hertfordshire offence.

The second half was a different story where the Immortals offence took charge, while the defence remained strong, and put up 12 points through a quarterback run that made over 50 yards by Bob Worksfromhome and lovely link up between Bob and Noach from Coventry. The hard running of Emmanuel Olagbaju and the explosive blocking from the offensive line, including Sweet Joe Downey, Ugly Henry Turner, Pecs Badham and Rookie Markus Mohr, allowed the passing game to be set up which gave the Immortals their second touchdown of the day.

There has to be a special mention for Kyung Hoon Moon who put in a massive effort taking snaps on offense as fullback, defence as linebacker and special teams. The game finished 22-12 to Hertfordshire but the game felt like anything but a loss with the Immortals more than holding their own, with so many injuries.

The Most Valuable Players were: Kyung Hoon Moon (overall), Bob Worksfromhome (offense), Alex Hitchinson (defence), Pecs Badham (line) and Markus Mohr (offense rookie). Make no mistake; this game was a statement to the rest of the league that the Imperial Immortals play premiership football with or without their ideal line-ups.
