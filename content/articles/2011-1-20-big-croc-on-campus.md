Word on the street is that next week will be a sweaty one for Biology fresher Marianne Teoh, as on Monday she gets engulfed by the crocodile suit which she’ll be confined to for the subsequent week. A far cry from the oh-so tiresome leg shaving and cookie baking ‘antics’ to which we’re all so accustomed, this campaign is one to watch. I decided to find out what it was all about.

__So... you’re wearing a crocodile suit, huh?__

That’s right. All day, all night, rain or shine, for as long as I can starting on Monday. Walking down the street with a bucket and sign can be a little, well, boring. My crocodile debut involved selling cupcakes around South Kensington: it generated loads of enthusiasm so I decided to take it to the next level.

This is just the beginning: these antics will continue, if I get the support. Watch this space.

__But why the humiliation? What’s the cause?__

This summer I will be volunteering with The Foundation for Mother and Child Health in Indonesia. The charity provides a way for communities to lift themselves out of extreme poverty – from feeding programmes, health, hygiene and nutritional education, to providing pre-school education, medical services, skills training and microcredit. The charity trains local community health workers to spread the word. As well as programmes in Indonesia, they now have a separate charity in the slums of Mumbai.

Following this placement I’ll be joining an Operation Wallacea project in Sulawesi as a research assistant. The Trust supports community-based forest conservation programmes in Indonesia, and students like me join as part of the research team to support the charity. Through research, teaching and community development they aim to maximise the benefits to local families while defending the rainforests.

__How can Imperialites help you on your quest?__

From my waking hour, while cycling to university, through lectures, and onto nights out clubbing, as well as everything in between, I’ll be confined to the crocodile suit. But as if that display of impracticality and downright stupidity isn’t enough, I’m open to suggestions, and I invite sponsored challenges from anyone!

If you’ll sponsor me on the condition that I have a photo taken performing an activity (keep it clean) or at a ridiculous location, such as atop Big Ben, then I’ll do my best to meet that challenge. So far I’m booked in for a dip at the Serpentine Lake next Friday – I’m determined to survive this one and look forward to getting more requests in the future!

__Wishing you the best of luck with the fundraising – croc on!__

We certainly wish Marianne all the best and hope that her experience in Indonesia is a valuable one. You can find out about how her travels work out in the follow-up article when she returns.
