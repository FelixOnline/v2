[Raincatcher Imperial](http://www.RaincatcherImperial.ac.uk) has been working tirelessly for the past months to fundraise for a water harvesting system in Tabora that will give clean, drinkable water for local schoolchildren. Coming up tomorrow (Saturday 25 February) is one of our biggest events of the year, our [Metric Night: Let it Rain](http://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/metric/event.html?Lid=0&Pevent=com.othermedia.imperial.model.EventHandle-L-2005#mainEvent).

Getting people involved in a charity is never easy, not least because it usually involves asking people to give you money and get nothing in return! This is why it is becoming more and more widespread for charities to mix music and charity. Listen to good music while helping children in third-world countries – what more could you possibly ask for?

For tomorrow’s Metric Night, Raincatcher has invited several notable artists to perform live. Space Heroes of the People, for example, are guaranteed to liven up our event with nothing but a double bass, some random drumming and their charming voices inspired by (quote) modern architecture, medieval history and soviet science fiction!

We’ll be having in-house acts as well, by performers from within Imperial College including acoustic performers Carmay Lin and Edward Myung, our rock guitarist and singer Oli Clipsham and the unmissable psychedelic rock band Neon People.

Of course, we’ve also catered for those with a slightly softer preference in music with a couple more gentle acts: Youtube singer-songwriter Aniya Das and acoustic musician Danny Adams.

So, whether you’re going for the great music, our fantastic raffle prize draw, to support our project in Tanzania or simply for a night out at Metric to have a couple of drinks, don’t hesitate to get tickets in advance for £3 or on the door for £5.
