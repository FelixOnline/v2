Imperial College London has confirmed students will not be examined on material missed as a result of the [ongoing strikes by the University and College Union (UCU)](http://felixonline.co.uk/articles/2018-02-23-strikes-hit-imperial-over-pensions-dispute/).

In an email sent to all students last Friday, 23rd February, Professor James Stirling, the Provost, and Professor Simone Buitendijk, Vice-Provost (Education), said they wanted to “reassure [students] that no students will be placed at a disadvantage due to the strike”. They told students: [“We can say with certainty that you will not be examined on any material that you have not been taught.”](https://twitter.com/ICU_President/status/967084976385789952) 

The email came two days into the strikes, which could last up to 14 days. UCU members voted to take industrial action following proposed changes to their pension scheme by Universities UK (UUK).

The email was followed by another message from Professor Buitendijk on Thursday, 1st March saying: “Every effort is being made to ensure that the overall goals of each module and degree programme are achieved. For Imperial modules and where the College has final authority, I can reiterate my assurances you will not be assessed on anything that has not been taught to you as a result of strike action.”

A number of students and staff have voiced concerns over whether or not assessments later this year would include material scheduled to be covered in contact time cancelled due to the strike. In an email sent to Prof. Stirling and Prof. Buitendijk earlier on Friday, Professor Michele Dougherty, head of the Department of Physics, expressed her worries over “uncertainty and lack of clarity from College”, and asked the College to “show sector leadership on this matter”.

One issue Prof. Dougherty highlighted was the expectation of departmental staff to minimise the impact the strike was having on students, which she said was “unreasonable and unviable”. 
Last week, over 700 students from the Department of Physics alone were affected, as nearly 60% of lecture contact hours and nearly 40% of tutorial contact hours had to be cancelled. Prof. Dougherty urged the College to “ensure that productive negotiations are reopened between UUK and the [UCU] without any further delay”.

In a statement for Felix, a Union representative said: “The Union is glad to see the College is addressing the concerns we have raised on behalf of our members regarding the impact of the current strikes. This is testament to the work of staff and student representatives across the College. We hope the College considers the other impacts of these strikes and takes action – urging UUK reopen negotiations between UUK and UCU.”

As well as concerns over examinations, a number of student academic representatives have been asking whether tuition fees would be refunded as a result of the strike action. A petition requesting a partial refund of tuition fees, started by students in the Electronic and Electrical Engineering (EEE) Department, currently has around 2,500 signatures. Students at other universities have started similar petitions, with [reports of the number of students demanding refunds increasing by 10,000 per day](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/feb/20/70000-students-call-for-compensation-over-ucu-lecturer-strike).

In the email, Prof. Stirling and Prof. Buitendijk said: “We have also heard from a number of students about their tuition fees and we will address this concern in due course.”

UCU is currently taking industrial action over changes to pension schemes, which it says could see academics and support staff losing out on thousands of pounds each year. Universities UK, the governing body proposing the changes, says the move is needed to ensure the sustainability of the scheme – a proposal UCU disagrees with.
