     Unless you breathe the fibres in in large quantities asbestos is no more dangerous than sand, and should certainly not be described as "highly toxic". In particular, asbestos in building materials is very likely to be locked into a cement matrix which makes it pretty much harmless. The correct way to deal with asbestos is to leave it alone and mark it so that no unsuspecting builder drills through it. This is almost certainly what the uni Asbestos Management Plan entails.

Recently released [College Council minutes](https://workspace.imperial.ac.uk/secretariat/Public/Minutes/Council/Council%20Minutes%2025%20Sept%202012.pdf) from last September have revealed the discovery of asbestos in the Skempton Building. The material, which is no longer used in construction, is highly toxic and leads to a range of respiratory illnesses.

The asbestos was found in the ductwork to Lecture theatre 2, which has now been “capped off” in order to safely deal with the situation. The College already has an Asbestos Management Plan in place for these situations to reduce any risk associated with asbestos.

The substance was found during the on-going works taking place in Skempton and its finding has led to delays with the refurbishment plans. The minutes state that the operation to remove the asbestos will take 8 weeks over either Easter or Summer.
