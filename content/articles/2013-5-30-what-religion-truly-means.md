[Isa’s name](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/3646/imperial-alumnus-killed-in-syria/) translates to “Jesus” in English; Jesus is an important prophet for Muslims, one who strived for the betterment of mankind. Isa tried to emulate the qualities of the prophet by devoting his youth, health, richness, time and, ultimately, life, for the sake of God through humanitarianism. This beautiful example is particularly relevant in light of the tragedy that occurred in Woolwich earlier this month, showing how religion can be and is a motivation towards beneficence. Isa left Britain to use his medical skills to save lives, and both his death and the death of Drummer Lee Rigby have brought sadness to a great many people. The Quranic verse related by Deputy PM Nick Clegg last week at a conference with Muslim leaders thus feels particularly relevant: “If anyone kills a human being, it shall be as though he killed all mankind. Whereas if anyone saves a life, it shall be as though he saved the whole of mankind.” My thoughts and prayers are with the families of both, and it is my hope we will see unity through their loss.
