JOHN, often known as JOHN (TIMESTWO) as both members of the duo are called John, have a brand spanking new album out. And as unimaginative as their band name is, this album is far from the same. Based out of Crystal Palace, South London, JOHN rode into the current post-punk wave along with the likes of Idles and Fontaines DC with guitars a-blazing, their sound a firm contrast to their Weezer-inspired indie look. Their first album, God Speed in the National Limit, was released in 2017 to rave reviews and led to supporting the aforementioned Idles on their European tour. Their latest release, Out Here on the Fringes, is sure to follow suit, being named the BBC’s album of the day last week and having had shout-outs from the crème-de-la-crème of rock including his majesty Iggy Pop. They seem to be onto something here. It all kicks off with jostling drums and guitar on the first single and album opener ‘Future Thinker’ before singer/drummer John Newton’s enticing growls enter. This track sets the tone for the rest of the record: its hyper, demanding nature is sweat-inducing as you feel yourself transported to a  hot, crowded venue whilst listening. The next track ‘Standard Hauntings’ is no different. Three songs in and you’re allowed a small break on the opening of the title-track ‘Out Here on the Fringes’: sliding guitars make way for heavy noise, with guitarist Johnny Healey intertwining punchy riffs with swooning feedback. It’s no surprise this is the album’s title-track, as the Johns restrain themselves for long enough to feel the circle-pit opening before everything crashes in. My personal favourites, ‘High Digger’ and ‘Dog Walker’ then kick in with riffs so repetitive and addictive that I wonder how I lived until now without them. The album wraps up with mysterious ‘Midnight Supermarket’ creeping into hard-hitting ‘Solid State’, two songs which transport you first to aisle 3 at witching hour and secondly to contemplating your own consistency, with lyrics such as “is it true, am I a solid state?”. Perhaps unsure about that, but I can guarantee JOHN are consistently hitting the post-punk scene with some solid tunes.
