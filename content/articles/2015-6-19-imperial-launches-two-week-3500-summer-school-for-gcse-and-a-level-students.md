Imperial is to host its first ever “Global Summer School,” giving under-eighteens a chance to live and study at the university for two weeks, at the cost of £3,500 a head.

The course, designed to attract “the highest achieving students from all corners of the globe” offers attendees a chance to participate in practical sessions, lectures and seminars.

The scheme also offers careers advice and guidance seminars on UCAS applications, interview skills, personal statement writing and workshops on applying to Medicine schools in the UK.

Attendees will be put up in halls near the South Kensington campus, in twin rooms. They will also be provided with meals three times a week, and social activities will also be included in the price.

Currently, there is no financial aid available for anyone wishing to attend this year, and all funds need to be paid upfront.

Places are awarded on a “first come, first served” basis. Those who wish to attend are required to submit a personal statement, a recommendation from a teacher or tutor, and an up to date academic transcript.

Felix spoke to a College spokesperson about the summer school. They explained the school is being run by the Student Recruitment team, and the school “is designed to give prospective students, especially from overseas, a chance to experience life at Imperial before they apply.

“Summer programmes are an important way of attracting students from countries where they might not traditionally think of studying overseas or in the UK, and the School currently has students attending from 49 different nationalities.”

When asked about the cost, the spokesperson explained that should any surplus funds be generated, the money will go back into the Outreach programmes ran by Imperial.

Said the spokesperson: “The Global Summer School has been costed to reflect the programme of hands-on activities offered, and is competitively priced compared to similar summer schools held at other UK universities.

“It does not receive funding beyond the income generated, and so fees must cover the costs involved.”

They also explained that over the summer, the college will still be running their other Outreach programmes as usual: “Six summer programmes for young people from disadvantaged schools will take place at Imperial as normal.

“In total, the College’s Outreach team expects to welcome around 450 pupils on campus over July and August. These programmes are fully funded for students using funds from central College and from external charities and organisations.”
