In a statement sent out by President Alice Gast and Provost James Stirling, Imperial students and staff were told that there will now be an increased presence of security at College’s campuses.

This announcement comes two days after 22 people were killed and dozens were injured at an Ariana Grande concert at the Manchester Arena. Another eight have been confirmed missing.

On Wednesday soldiers were put on guard outside Buckingham Palace and Downing Street after Theresa May said another attack may be “imminent”.
Although the President and the Provost reassured members of Imperial that there is no reason to suspect any specific threat to our institution or other universities, it also warned the Imperial community “to remain vigilant and to immediately report anything suspicious to Security”.

A College spokesperson said new security measures will include “increasing both the number of patrols and the number of officers stationed in public areas around the campuses. We are also working closely with our neighbours to enhance safety and security in the surrounding areas as well as on campus.”

College urges students who have been affected to contact their personal tutors, supervisors, senior tutors or the College tutors at any point.  For staff, free confidential help is available from Confidential Care 24 hours a day, by telephone (0800 085 4764) or online.
