It is with deep regret that _Felix_ shares the sad news that Muhammad Hafiz Bin Zainal (known as Hafiz), who joined the Department of Chemistry as an undergraduate student in 2015, has died.
 
During his time at Imperial, Hafiz was very much involved in student societies and the wider Imperial community. Hafiz was an active member of ICTV, through which he cultivated a passion for filming and videography.

Many will be deeply affected by this awful news; staff and students alike in need of emotional support are encouraged to reach out to the [Counselling Service](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/counselling/) or the [Chaplaincy](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/chaplaincy/).

For students that wish to organise any activities in honour of Hafiz, please contact Emelie Helsen, Interim Head of Student Experience, via e-mail at: e.helsen@imperial.ac.uk.  
 
The thoughts of the _Felix_ team and the wider Imperial community are with Hafiz’s family and friends at this difficult time.
