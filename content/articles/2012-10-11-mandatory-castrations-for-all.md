     To start from the basics, to be cisgendered is where your gender and biological sex match. Gender being whether you feel male/female/other. (Judith Butler has written an excellent book on why biological sex cannot be defined, if you're interested) <br>I'm cisgendered, and you probably are too (although these are just labels) and because of this you can go about your life as you usually would. In an ideal world transgendered people would be able also but in reality this isn't always the case. This is cisprivilege, that cisgendered people have the privilege of doing things that transgendered people cannot.,Hi there, social justice warrior. You might have noticed that we have pretty much the same beliefs and are fighting for the same causes, but I don't have a fanatic determination to attack people who are, essentially, on my side. <br> <br>If you read closely, you'll notice that I've been careful to use constructions such as 'all genders' to avoid a binary, which you've blithely ignored in favour of a single slip-up, wh

Because that’s what feminism’s all about, right? Right? Wrong, but from the incredulous looks, comments and questions we got at Freshers’ Fair, it seems like a lot of you really believe that the goals of feminism are to overthrow and subjugate men and introduce a gynocratic fempire. Consider your entrance to Imperial and this article your welcome to reality. You’re in the real world now, and you’re here to learn. So, get learning:

What actually is feminism, then?

The belief that men and women should have equal rights and should not be judged based on their gender. Nothing more, nothing less. It’s not about female supremacism or misandry: it’s about equality.

But men and woman are equal! Sexism doesn’t exist any more.
 No, they aren’t: a quick look at Imperial’s gender ratio will show you that women are still encouraged away from “hard” subjects. In business and politics women are underpaid and underrepresented, with each becoming more male-dominated further up the ladder. Their appearance, weight and personal lives are obsessed over (see this paper’s comments on Louise Mensch last year), and they are frequently victims of harassment, sexual assault, and rape.

Men are oppressed too: look at how few men get custody in divorce cases! Also, men can be raped and abused as well.

We know, and we care about these issues. Yes, really. Feminists believe in equality for all genders: our society tells us that women, not men, should care for children, and thus women get custody (although in fact, when men bother to fight for custody, the majority get it). Feminists want this to change. As for male rape and abuse? Of course, we want those to end too, but they have a small incidence compared to similar abuse against women, which is why you’ll hear us talking about them less.

I’m an equlist/humanist because I care about all issues, so I’m not a feminist.

Yes, you are. “Feminism,” although about equality, gets its name from the fact that women are currently the oppressed gender, and when the movement started, were truly second-class citizens, unable to vote, buy property or get an official education. So, what about racism, homophobia, transphobia and other forms of bigotry? Those are issues we care about as well, and in many cases, there’s a big overlap with them and feminism: this is something we call intersectionality.
 I heard feminists believe X.

There is no singular defining philosophy or belief in feminism, save for gender equality. Sure, some feminists may believe what you’ve heard, but that doesn’t mean all, or even a majority, of them do.
 I’m a man, can I still be a feminist?

Anyone can be a feminist. It doesn’t matter if you’re male, female, gay, straight (or anywhere in between); whether you shave your legs or not or whether your hair is short or long.
 How can I be a good feminist?

First of all, educate yourself. Read up on terms like privilege, intersectionality, slut-shaming and rape. Secondly, stop generalising: any time you think, “women are all X,” stop and consider that for a moment: really? Are all women like that? If you think it’s wrong when people say that all men are sex-crazed brutes, realise that similar generalisations about women are just as wrong, and congratulations, you’re a feminist!

What does the Feminist Society do?

The Feminist Soc is just a place for like-minded people to gather together in a safe space. We’re planning on hosting speakers during the year, film nights, a book club and probably a fair few bar nights. We’re welcome to people of all genders, orientations and persuasions so feel free to come along to any of our events if you’re interested.

Join our Facebook group at facebook.com/groups/ICFeministSociety/ or come along to meet us in 568 on Monday, the 15th of October, from 6 o’ clock.
