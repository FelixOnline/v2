On Monday the winners of the RCSU Science Challenge were announced at the Science Challenge Final, held at the Churchill War Rooms.

The competition was open to Imperial students and school children who were tasked with chosing one of three essay questions or the video question.

The overall winner of the competition was Emma Wills (also a contributor to Felix Science) who wrote an essay Pallab Ghosh’s 9 year old daughter, encouraging her to study Exoplanets when she reaches university.

The judges, Prof. Fay Dowker, former Felix Editor Pallab Ghosh, Jon Kudlick of the Society of Biology and former RCSU President Dr. Jad Marrouche picked winning entries for both Imperial and school submissions.
