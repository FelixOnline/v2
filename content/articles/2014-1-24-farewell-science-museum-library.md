 - Why not use the extra space to house some air conditioning units to make Level 4 livableIm not desperate or anythingBut seriously can Felix run an article on WHY the library is so hot Its common knowledge to the point of being a running joke throughout college but I dont understand why one cant just fix the problemI graduated in 2006 and remember the library being incredibly hot on both the 4th and 5th floors I also remember the annoying recorded announcements about the library closing in the years that it wasnt open 24hrs  Nice to see nothing has changed in 8 yearsThats a shame the museum collection has always been pleasant for a Wednesday afternoon browse

This week the Science Museum announced that they have come to a mutual agreement with College to relocate the Science Museum Library as part of a scheme that will create a new Science Museum research centre at it’s South Kensington site.

The move, which will take place over approximately six weeks, will commence on Feburary 3rd, and will see the entire 3rd floor collection move to the Science Musuem’s library and holding facility in Wroughton.

The primary undergraduate student use of the Science Museum library has been as a study space, while the library often caters to the literary needs of the museum staff. While the move will see the removal of the entire collection, many books in the collection are also available at other museums like the British Library and the Senate House library, both in London. Students will also be able to visit the Wroughton library via appointment if they require books that are unique to the Science Museum.

The College Library staff have the concern of students as their top priority and will be working to ensure that disruption is minimal while the books are in transit. They will also provide alternate locations for the 36 study spaces available in the Sci. Museum library and will try to keep noise to a minimum. They will also be compiling a list of Frequently Asked Questions for students to consult about the move and how they can access books that they may need from the collection in the future.

Simon Harding-Roots, Imperial’s Chief Operations Officer, said: “I’m very pleased that, by working closely with the Science Museum, we have a plan for the future that works for both partners. On our South Kensington Campus space is at a premium, so freeing some up through the new arrangement will be incredibly helpful for our teaching and research activities. We look forward to working closely with the Science Museum, and its new research centre, in the years to come.”

After the departure of the Science Museum library, the space will remain empty while a commitee convenes in College to discuss the best way in which to use spaces around campus, lead by Professor Stephen Richardson Associate Provost (Institutional Affairs). Student feedback will be welcomed in considerations of future uses of the space.

In the meanwhile if students and staff have any queries regarding the changes taking place the library is available for communcation via__ library@imperial.ac.uk.__
