Sarah Greasley, an Imperial postgraduate student, has received her certificate for the new World Record. She managed a total of 127 kisses in the end.

The record wasbroken in Ethos by the Materials postgraduate student. She seems to be excited about the record.

[Felix actually helped her by publishing an article last term about the record breaking attempt.](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/2882/most-kisses-in-one-minute-record-broken-at-imperial/)

Sarah had previously broken three Guinness World Records: most sticky notes on a body, most CDs flipped and caught in one minute, and most champagne bottles opened in one minute. She had previously attempted the most kisses received in one minute record, however the record was discounted due to technicalities.
