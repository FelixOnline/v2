Half-way through the season, and everything is extremely bright for Imperial College Basketball so far! The teams which entered the British Universities & Colleges Sport (BUCS) leagues have been performing outstandingly. The Men’s 1st team tops its league, and is still undefeated (just like the Philadelphia 76ers, only the other way round). The Women’s 1st and Men’s 2nd teams are respectively 4th and 2nd in their league.

We’ve also enjoyed a great turnout to our weekly Saturday development sessions, where students get to work on their individual skills and learn fundamental offensive and defensive moves. Michael Wells, Development Sessions Secretary, reflects on this: “Here in development sessions, we have two primary goals: to improve our basketball skills, and to have fun! Our sessions are usually split into two sections: the first forty-five minutes consist of warm-ups and different drills that serve to improve a different area each week. For the rest of the session, we run games of either 4v4 or 5v5, full court, where we try to incorporate the various things we have learned each week”. In addition, with ICU Basketball’s fast expansion, we may potentially start a third Men’s team next season. So everyone is welcome to join the sessions, whether or not you would like to join the teams!

Finally, may I take this opportunity to invite everyone that may be interested to our Winter Basketball Tournament (you do not have to be a member to come and play). This will take place at Ethos on Saturday 13th December from 14:00 to 17:00, and it will be good fun. There is no requirement regarding how skilful you are basketball-wise, just make sure you bring some enthusiasm! For more information, shoot us an email at _basketball@imperial.ac.uk_ or like us on Facebook (Imperial College London Basketball).
