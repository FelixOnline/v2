Following on from a very brief report in Felix earlier this year, there are still problems with Bucs.
 There are currently two options being given to all of the teams, with a lower possibility, at the present time, of keeping the current status quo.

The two options are to do with how the membership of sports teams is. The first option is that all teams will be split with only medics allowed in the medics teams, and only non-medics allowed in the non-medics teams. This means that students have a restriction on which of the options they are allowed to choose.

The other option is that the two teams are not split, and allowing medics and non-medics to choose

whichever team they want. However, as both would fall under the umbrella of Imperial, there are issues with what happens if a team were to forfeit their match. It would also mean that there is a limited number of teams that could be allowed in each individual league. This means some teams could be ‘promoted’ only to not go up and play at a level more appropriate for them.

Currently, the system allows for a studentto make a decision between the two choices. It also allows a student to pick a different team based on what sport it is, meaning a student could play IC football, but Medics rugby. This would also go.

The changes only affects a handful of universities around the UK.
