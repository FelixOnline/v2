Ultimate is played across three divisions: Open, Mixed and Women’s. Any player is eligible to play in the Open division, although the highest levels are dominated by men. The Mixed division requires a combination, usually split three to four, of both men and women where the two genders compete as equals, an unusual scenario in team sports. Finally the Women’s division, although the smallest, is becoming increasingly competitive not only at national and international level but also in university sport. Three of Imperial’s female players give their insight into what makes women’s Ultimate unique.

Meg Claverley, captain of the Imperial women’s team, explained that while female players are capable of the skills of their male counterparts, victory is determined more often by ingenuity rather than by physicality. “It’s about the communication and how each player plays off of the rest of the team. In Women’s, the game is more often won because you figured out the other team’s tactics and shut them down rather than having faster players and longer throws.” She also highlights the team spirit within the female branch of dD, affectionately known as Double-D. “Women’s Ultimate at Imperial is a relatively small group of people, which makes us really close and also gives you a lot of opportunities on the team. It’s given me a better understanding of the game than I would have had otherwise and also meant that I play a lot!”

Áine Ní Bhreasail, a PhD student at Imperial, likes to play across all three Ultimate divisions. “Open is interesting as a woman because you often have to mark or be marked by a guy. In some cases you will be as fast as him, but in other cases you aren’t and have to use tactics and skill to beat them rather than brute strength.” As well as for Imperial, she plays for one of the best club teams in London, Crown Jewels. “Training at a club level involves working on teamwork and tactics. The focus for university Ultimate is often teaching beginners the basics of the game, and this means that the training is often based on personal skills. I think the two complement each other quite well.” She also represented Ireland at the World Under-23 Championships in Florence last summer. “We were given a 16-week fitness plan before the tournament with both aerobic and core twice a week. The support we got from our team mates and coach was amazing. I have never cared more about a game before, for every game and every point I ran harder than I thought possible.” Sport Imperial has recognised her achievement, awarding her a scholarship to help her reach the next level – playing for Ireland’s senior team in the European Championships later this year.

Ailing Teo began playing Ultimate in October, having heard about it from her boyfriend. She admits that coming into a new sport was quite daunting; having to learn the rules, develop new skills and improving fitness are intimidating prospects which face anyone new to the game. “The players in women’s Ultimate have been really supportive, giving me advice about improving my game-play and teaching me different techniques. The club members make it really fun to learn.” Imperial College Ultimate prides itself on its ability to include anyone who wants to play, with the vast majority of its members having never played before coming to university.

When asked about their personal highlights in women’s Ultimate, their three responses were very similar. Meg mentioned Women’s Winter League, a tournament held over a number of Sundays in which players entered individually and were placed into teams. Several Imperial players played with some of the best female competitors in the UK, making new friends and connections in the women’s Ultimate community. Áine agrees; “the friends that you make and the fun that you have on a women’s team can’t be beaten,” although trailing all game to Finland at the World Championships, only to steal the game and win on a sudden death point in forty-degree heat, comes a close second. Ailing, having played for only four months, summarises their sentiment well. “The club has been really encouraging and try to involve the newcomers in the external matches. When we play against other universities we do not meet competitors, we meet new friends. I think this is really what makes Ultimate unique from other sports.”
