 - Who chose the headline and thought it was even slightly acceptable pleaseHey if you actually want to understand the viewpoint of a feminist and why the issues go deeper than gaining a better place within the patriarchy I know some people whod be only too happy to explain why theyre feminists and what it meansAlso why accepting nonsense patriarchal stereotypes is really damaging Theres some really nasty stuff here thats just used to dehumanise women and make them seem unable to think rationally allowing their views to be ignoredClair to answer your question yes I am a feminist I believe in gender equality I believe that physical gender separation needs to evolve to simply human being I believe that if a woman wants to wear short skirts she should not be called a slut In the same way if a woman wants to wear a hijab as part of her beliefs this right should be respected Feminism however has many branches and I do not agree with all of them hence the them that you pointed out

I am writing from the kitchen, the place where my family believe I belong, having given me an apron, tea towels, cookbooks and sponges for Christmas. Feminism is committing suicide. Last week, the BBC’s adaptation of Arthur Conan Doyle’s _Sherlock_ was criticised for being sexist. In my opinion, this was another example of where feminism is going wrong by creating bad press. The allegations were purely based on a far-fetched interpretation of the last fifteen minutes of the show.

It is not because a woman takes “advice” from a man, has feelings for another and is saved from being beheaded by him that she is a “pawn “ in the game of men or the weaker sex. The ending was criticised for being changed from Irene Adler’s victory in the original story to her losing against the Holmes brothers. That is quite simply called dramatization for entertainment’s purpose. Adler greets the famous detective in the full nude, giving away the code to her safe (her measurements – obviously a key factor in a woman’s worth). It was sexy, not sexist.

Feminists are slowly becoming repeat offenders in this area, following Apple’s Siri scandal in the USA. Picking up on small details, over-interpreting them and then proceeding to make a big deal out of it. This is not helping their cause whatsoever. The point is to obtain the same rights and opportunities for women as those available to men. Then again, when the voices of feminism come across as those of hormonal, loud, strongly opinionated beings picking at mere details, the result can only be negative.

The stereotype of an active feminist is that of an angry lesbian with half her hair shaved off. Men mock women for being overemotional, irrational, picky and constantly moaning. How can you expect to improve that image and prospects of women with behavous such as this? In that case, they may just as well surrender to sexism and go back to their ovens. A form of extremism is developing in feminism. This might be the worst service rendered to the cause because its portrayal is so bad.

So instead of depreciating the general view of the fairer sex, feminists should calm down, take a step back and concentrate on real issues. Like the “Reclaim the Night” campaign (fighting against sexual crimes and for safer streets at night). Not a BBC TV drama that pictures a strong woman, “THE Woman”, proving to be Sherlock Holmes’ equal.
