 - Given the Chemistry department currently has two lecture theatres each seating 100 for a yearly intake of 150 students this can only be a good thingIts a partial move though Pippa  the potential scenario of people constantly jumping between sites will take so much out of your day and may waste valuable bscmscmsci research timeEven if all undergrad teaching is localised on one site and note the sucky experience if teaching is localised at imperial west but that can probably be resolved it will be a very painful experience for anyone who will have to jump between sites many times a day in their fourth year who has to balance lectures and researchOf course the plans show no dedicated chemistry building so it could be something else entirely migrate over all of theoretical and computation into plush offices but itll be interesting to see how this will work in practice ifwhen an official announcement is forthcoming as without elaboration some rather major flaws can be seenYes

Following an email from the Rector to staff this morning it has been revealed that parts of the Chemistry department will be moved to the Imperial West campus.

As part of recent study of critical path issues on the entire College estate, master planners have established several parts of the South Kensington campus where space has become an issue. It was felt that the provisions for these areas was below what College aspires to as part of it's goal to become a world leading adacemic institution in the coming years. These buildings (the Chemistry building, the Blackett Building and the Huxley building) have been identified as being on the "critical path" of the assessment due to the need of more space for core academic functions in need of new facilities that can be solved by new buildings or refurbishment. It has been decided that some functions of departments will probably be required to relocate to the Imperial West campus in order to acquire more space.

The Chemistry Department has agreed with College Cabinet that Chemistry has the highest need of new space due to intensive laboratory use and requirements and it has been decided that the need to move some parts of the Chemistry to facilities is "pressing". This has lead to the creation of a detailed feasibility study of the possible options, along side options for refurbishment and future use of the building.

if this affects you, please email [felix@imperial](mailto:felix@imperial).ac.uk with your concerns.
