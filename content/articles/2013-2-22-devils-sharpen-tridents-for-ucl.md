Forget the Medics, everybody knows Imperial’s true rivals are UCL. They may have a more girls, reading weeks and the arguably the biggest Harlem Shake in Europe but they certainly don’t have the best university ice hockey team in London. A point that will be emphatically proven on Friday 1st March when the mighty Imperial Devils take on the UCL Yetis in the biggest grudge match of the season, the London Ice Varsity. The adrenaline-filled, full-contact contest will see the oldest London uni ice hockey club (us) take on the new kids on the block in front of hundreds of noisy supporters providing an electric atmosphere at Brixton Ice Arena (a couple of mins walk from Brixton underground station on the Victoria line), a place both teams call home. Past ‘friendlies’ promise a finely poised battle, with the Devils playing in the division above but with the Yetis having a recent run of form in their favour. With the bragging rights of clinching the inaugural London Ice Varsity title up for grabs, it will undoubtedly be the team who rises up to the occasion on the day who will take the honours. One thing is certain – a great night’s entertainment, not only with the hard-hitting action of the fastest team sport on earth but also figure skating demonstrations, a skills contest and DJs running throughout. Doors open at 7.45pm for an 8pm puck drop so BYOB for the most entertaining pre-lash ever; the game will finish by 10.30pm and food and drink (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) will be available at the rink. Tickets are just £5 from tinyurl.com/icevaristy (use QR code) so come and show your support as Imperial crush UCL in a cracking game of real hockey.
