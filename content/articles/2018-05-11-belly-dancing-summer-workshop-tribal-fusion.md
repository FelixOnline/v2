During the summer term, due to exams, the Belly Dancing Society pauses its regular class timetable in favour of one-off classes or workshops. This term we have three workshops lined up, the first off which is happening next Thursday, and will be in the modern style of Tribal Fusion Belly Dance. 
Tribal Fusion Belly Dance is a western belly dance style originating in San Francisco, USA, in the ‘60s, which fuses middle eastern belly dance with elements of flamenco, hip-hop, Kathak, Odissi, and a variety of folkloric dance styles from around the world.  

We’ve invited Alexis Southall to London to teach the foundations of this fun and quirky belly dance style; Alexis is an internationally renowned professional teacher and performer of Fusion Bellydance and Improvisational Tribal Style (ITS) based in Wolverhampton, UK, and is known for her unique style, flawless musicality, precise technique, and dedicated and engaging teaching.

During this class we will work through the fundamental vocabulary and movement approach of Tribal Fusion bellydance. Throughout the class you will have the option to increase the complexity through travelling steps and arm patterns, or to concentrate on the base movement, meaning this class is suitable for any experience level, including complete beginners to belly dancing! Tribal Fusion is characterised by fluidity contrasted with precise isolations, and we will cover both of these approaches in class. We will finish the class by stringing this vocabulary together into combinations to get you really dancing!

We hope you’ll join us for this workshop – if you can’t make it but are still interested in learning to belly dance with us, we have a Belly-Hoop fitness class coming up on 14th June and a Saidi (a form of belly dance performed with canes) class on the 21st June. Email bellydancing@imperial.ac.uk for details!

When: 18:00 - 20:00, Thursday 17th May
Where: Activity Space 1, Union Building
Tickets: £10 for members, £12 for non-members – on the door or on the Union website
