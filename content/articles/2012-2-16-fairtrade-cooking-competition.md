The annual Fairtrade Fortnight is soon upon us! To kick-start the festivities the ICU Fairtrade Society is hosting a competition to find the most scrumptious ethical chef at Imperial!

__How to enter:__
 1. Simply cook your amazing meal (it can be any type: starter, breakfast, tea, dinner, dessert, etc.)
 2. Write up your recipe including the ingredient brands used. The recipe can be inspired by existing ones, however, your personal twist should be added.
 3. Shoot some photos of your meal and the ingredients you used.
 4. Send in points 2 and 3 to: food.felix@imperial.ac.uk

Group and multiple entries are welcome!

__Judging entries:__
 The competition is judged by how good the presentation of the meal is, how tasty the recipe reads and the percentage of Fairtrade products used in the recipe. The presentation and recipe categories are judged democratically on the Fairtrade website. Each category is weighted equally and amounts to a total score, defining the winner!

Each participant will receive free entry to a Fairtrade Fortnight event of their choice, including the popular All You Can Eat Ben & Jerry and Cheese & Wine nights! Therefore, the earlier the entry the greater the choice of events!

__Prizes:__
 The lucky winners will receive the following prizes:
 1st place: Â£30 voucher for [EthicalSuperstore.com](http://EthicalSuperstore.com)
 2nd and 3rd place: A Fairtrade Cookbook (TBC)

__Deadline:__
 The deadline for submissions for the competition is Saturday 3 March.
 Remember, Fairtrade products can be recognised by the trademark printed on their packaging (see above image).
