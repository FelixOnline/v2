_Don Quixote_ is a sumptuous delve into Spain through Miguel de Cervante’s classic story. It follows the eccentric Don who, through reading too many old tales, believes he is a knight and goes out seeking adventure with his faithful squire Sancho. Their misadventures involve helping young lovers Kitri and Basilio evade Lorenzo (her father) and Gamache (the proposed suitor). It’s hardly smooth sailing for the pair, but all ends well in an impressive final wedding scene.

Carlos Acosta’s daring new choreography for the Royal Ballet was introduced in 2013 alongside the fantastic score by Ludwig Minkus. The sumptuous music transports you to the Mediterranean and was wonderfully conducted on the night by Martin Yates. Acosta wished to show off the full cast in this large-scale ballet, so alongside the traditional solos and pas de deux, there are many marvellous group sections for the corps de ballet.

Throughout the night it was a delight to watch Kitri (Marianela Nuñez) and Basilio (Vadim Muntagirov). Both gave truly outstanding performances with great characterisation and impressive technique. Nuñez perfectly achieved the remarkable 32 fouettés in Act III, travelling en pointe, escalating grand jetés and effortlessly held the many balances. All this whilst lighting up the audience with her radiant smile. Muntagirov caused the audience to gasp with his remarkable split leaps, displayed impressive pirouettes and jumps, and conveyed elegance in every moment.

The level of trust and togetherness shown by the pair was revealed in the final pas de deux, with the incredibly difficult ‘fish dives’ seemingly effortless.

Alongside them were a number of standout performances. Kitri’s cheery friends, played by Yuhui Choe and Beatriz Stix-Brunell, pulled off the difficult pas de deux. Laura Morera portrayed a delightfully flirtatious Mercedes alongside Ryoichi Hirano’s arrogant Espada. During the dream sequence of Act II, Fumi Kaneko made the complex routine as Queen of the Dryads seem effortless with delightful extensions, and Anna Rose O’Sullivan provided a wonderfully exuberant Amour.

Another highlight was brought by the corps de ballet in the gypsy scene at the start of Act II – the more contemporary repertoire delightfully brought it to life. 

This performance requires just as much talented acting as it does dancing. In this vein Don Quixote (Christopher Saunders), Sancho Panza (David Yudes), Lorenzo (Gary Avis) and Gamache (Bennet Gartside) are brilliantly performed,  bringing real moments of comedy to the stage. Yudes in particular had wonderful comedic timing.

At times Acosta’s ambitious choreography can leave the stage feeling crowded, with almost too many things to see at once. This combined with Tim Hatley’s moving set, although beautifully setting the scene, can at times be distracting. However, despite these things, it is a brilliant move in modern ballet, reenergising the perceived stiffness of classical ballets. 

This vibrant and highly comedic production, combined with the amazing talent of Nuñez and Muntagirov is definitely one not to miss.
