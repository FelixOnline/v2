Imperial students have made it through to the BP Ultimate Field Trip semi-finals. Four Imperial teams (X-tek, Team Griffon, Energineers & The Next Frontier) have reached the semi-finals stage, which will be held on the 3rd-4th February across the UK.

The Ultimate Field Trip is the UK’s flagship student competition; it enables some of the brightest individuals studying STEM subjects to work in teams and answer a real life business challenge. The winning team receives a 2 week international field trip with BP. The Ultimate Field Trip is now in its fifth year. This year winners from the UK, US, Canada, Angola, Trinidad and Tobago will visit both Alaska and Chicago.

A BP representative said: “This year, the challenge has been to identify an innovative solution that will significantly reduce energy consumption and be implemented by 2025, with the potential to scale across the energy industry.”

The semi-finals will be taking place in the first week of February at BP’s office in Sunbury; four teams will go into the finals that will be held on 10 March in the Royal Institution.
