Two Imperial students, Aran Kankiwala and Shi Yunn Chua, have won a competition that gave them the prize of a three-day all expenses paid program of events in Rotterdam last week as Shell’s special VIP guests.

They were two of the 20 winning students. The winners were from the UK, Germany and Norway, and they won a host of prizes. The first being the VIP pass to the Shell Eco-marathon Europe 2013. This is an event where students have to design, build and drive the most energy-efficient car. They also won the chance to go to the “Powering Progress Together conference”. This is a discussion on the future challenges on energy, water and food with speakers including the Mayor of Rotterdam, CEO Energy Sector of Siemens and the CEO of Royal Dutch Shell. The Imperial students also won an interview and a dinner with senior members of Shell.
