Me being me, and this being only my second ever comedy gig, I was a little sceptical about certain aspects of last Friday’s line-up at __The Hammersmith Apollo__. A childrens’ entertainer? Musicians telling jokes? Charity?! Retrospectively, however, my aversion to live comedy was wholly unfounded. I loved it. Being a one-night-only gig, I’m not sure however as to what a Felix report should say other than “ha, I got to see the show and you didn’t”. My perception of reviews is that they are a tool for promoters yearning to sell more tickets to subsequent nights’ shows. Perhaps I’m supposed to plug next year’s concert (it’s an annual thing for ‘Friends of the Earth’, a charity whose main focus for the foreseeable future is Climate Change). Or perhaps I’m supposed to plug comedy gigs in particular. Whatever it is, overall the whole night was exemplary.
> As a mathematician, the evening particularly appealed to my inner geek
Our host for the evening, [_The Inbetweeners_’ Greg Davies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFhn0h0uXeU) skilfully compered. Whilst his ‘bulky’ 6’8” frame and ill-fitting T-Shirt was the cause of much discomfort for the front three rows of the stalls, it was also the main subject of his self-degradation and consequent enjoyment of the audience.

As a mathematician, the evening particularly appealed to my inner geek. [Richard Herring](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtjx-yplqTw), after warming up with a few disconnected jokes finally stuck with the story of his Fererro Rocher Valentines Day promise, as well as to how his failure to appreciate exponential growth (\Sigma{2^{years together}}) will bankrupt him.

Headliner [Tim Minchin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVN_0qvuhhw) stuck with the mathematical tack and convinced the audience that comedians who try out new material in small groups aren’t taking large enough sample sizes – and that anything below the Apollo’s (sold-out) capacity of three-thousand two hundred would make the test unfair. He noted that 90% of the audience had no idea what a p-value was, and that out of those that did, 90% would again notice he hadn’t a clue what he was talking about. With any sample size, Minchin’s “new” material – a song called ‘Context’, which he sang twice (once with only half the words, and once with the full set) – rivalled, in my opinion some of his classics.
> crude, yet hilarious ‘alternative’ verses slurred by as the wine took its toll.
A musical interlude just prior to the interval caught me slightly off guard; [Badly Drawn Boy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B11msns6wPU), the once homeless man, wasn’t quite what I was expecting from the evening, but he seemed to go down well with the majority of the audience. The musician’s jokes however, were slightly less well received; his tales weren’t a patch on those told by his colleagues over the course of the evening.

The music continued and took a Christmas-sy twist after the interval with “childrens’ entertainer” Jeremy Iron, and his drinking-game version of ‘The Twelve Days of Christmas’. Thankfully the evening hadn’t been marketed at children, as, apart from the FIVE GOLD RINGS, not many of the lyrics remained intact: crude, yet hilarious, ‘alternative’ verses slurred by as the wine consumed as part of Iron’s drinking-game took its toll.

The encore for the evening transported me back to three years to school via a song I remember singing at my own Leavers’ concert. Minchin closed with a magical audience participation rendition of Buckley’s ‘Hallelujah’. Performed in pitch black, the song completed a perfect eclectic mix of entertainment, calling a close on a superb evening.
