Jessica is a graduate from the Innovation Design Engineering (IDE) course, which is a joint _Imperial_ and _RCA_ course.

“My background is business and accounting, but I’ve been developing my interest in art, design, and music since I was very little with my parent’s support.” She said that in Asian culture it is usual to have a practical backup, hence why she did accounting as an undergraduate degree. She later had the opportunity to study in the USA, where she took mostly design courses. This is when she realised that design was the best fit for her as she enjoys exploring her creative side. She now works at _Ogilvy One_, where she focuses on designing screen-based products.

On the IDE course she learnt about engineering. This helped her with designing, and she said that after going on the course it “totally changed” her. She said that she wanted to “design something practical, but, for good design, the user should be very engaged with the object.”

She has weaved a blending of the senses into her design. Her final year project at the _RCA_ was “about exploring sound and how people can manipulate sound”. She wanted to “combine all the sensorial experiences together, so manipulating sound is not just through hearing, but a sense of touch and sense of smell as well”. This has been integrated into smart phone technology with the Sonic way-finder, which “combines the two experiences” of using maps to find a destination and listening to music. When walking, if you go off track, then you hear a difference in the music that you are playing. Therefore the sound guides you to your destination.

Jessica explains how collaboration is key in design and finding the right people to work with is all important: “it’s not about your personal achievement, it’s about how a team can make the most out of their capabilities for a project.” When learning technical skills from other people, such as programming and electronics, she stressed how it is not all about just learning the new tool and how the person teaching her also helps in “learning about design; it’s mutually beneficial, it’s not just learning the skills, it’s about learning the thinking process of other people”.

Designers should have a broad knowledge set, in Jessica’s view. “You need to be exposed to people, to know what they want and how they use things. And then also have adequate knowledge, so that, when you come up with an idea, you have the skills and knowledge to make it happen”. This is because “design is applying solutions: you have to find the most efficient way [to solve the problem]”.
