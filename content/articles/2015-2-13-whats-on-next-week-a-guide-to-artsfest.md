__ArtsFest Lecture: DarwinTunes__

Dr Bob MacCallum is a researcher at Imperial who is looking at the evolutionary aspects of music – how come we like certain tunes and rhythms? He set up a website to test whether random noise could eventually become music through a selection process. Join us for a very exciting lecture that combines science – the core of Imperial College – with music as part of ArtsFest.

Tuesday 18:00

__Writing Workshop /Book Blind Date__

Writers’ Soc and IC Science Fiction bring you this event – a drop-in writing workshop and book blind date. Join in whenever you like between 18:00 and 20:00 for writing exercises, and learn more about the upcoming Writing Competition organised by the two societies. You will also leave with an unknown book, and perhaps not one that you would have picked up in the first place, which is a great way to discover a new author or genre.
