     With my daughter currently going though the process of trying to find suitable accommodation for her second year I am amazed that there is no referral system available between IC students. Why aren't good flats and houses pased from 1 year to the next? There doesn't even seem to be any forum available to advertise for spare rooms/extra sharers - someone there is missing an opportunity.

[Last week](http://felixonline.co.uk/comment/2440/league-table-woes-not-a-problem/) Felix commented that it could be worthwhile to focus on improving the 'student experience' from within rather than from focusing on comparison with other universities. If anything, [it has emerged](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/2454/hall-senior-prospects-in-doubt/) that focusing internally would indeed be beneficial regarding the current Wilson House hall senior situation.

With seniors originally under the impression that they would be guaranteed accommodation somewhere as Wilson undergoes refurbishment next year, those that have been recruited for the position have been told that this could be untenable, with the plans of many of these individuals thrown into turmoil, and rooms potentially being sought externally to reach the guaranteed amount of accommodation for next year's intake.

At the heart of the issue, it falls to College and what has been described as "a severe lack of communication" on their part with the Wardens of Imperial in order to keep those most at risk of losing out in the loop with ongoing developments. After all, miscommunication on this level cannot be, in any way, shape, or form, be beneficial for the 'student experience'.

Wardens and those holding senior positions in halls of accommodation should be the first to be made aware of events such as refurbishments rather than being the first to hear of "hints". After all, people have chosen to live in this fashion, providing help to those who need it, and being kept in the dark with respect to this is simply not beneficial for any kind of mutual relationship.

Students are the first to suffer from the lack of knowledge that their seniors and wardens can provide. The wardening system at Imperial is an important facet of the community, especially for Freshers and their adjustment to a new way of life and independence. Anything that could potentially damage the relationship between the wardening team and students goes to ultimately damage the 'student experience'. It is important that during the next stages of any potential hall closure and the Wilson House refurbishment that there is clear communication between the relevant parties, and that there is full and clear. Otherwise, dissatisfaction will be an easily apparent prospect.

The closure of various halls of accommodation that has been regularly touted as an option throughout the year begs the question as to why Imperial should be in this position in the first place. The circumstances that led to a shortfall in the required rooms for next year's intake must be heavily considered.
