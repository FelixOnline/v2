After a successful first season, [_Sherlock_](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b018ttws) is back on our screens. Giving the detective stories a 21st century make-up, the second season does not disappoint. In fact it picks up exactly where it left off, full of suspense, comedy and twists. The way things are turning out, Sherlock should be added to everyone’s must-watch list.

The first episode titled ‘A Scandal in Belgravia’ lifts the story to a new high as Sherlock finds himself tackling Irene Adler, a dominatrix with some compromising photographs of a member of the royal family. Being hired by the highest in the land, it’s up to Sherlock to save the monarchy’s face but soon he finds that there’s more afoot than a simple blackmailer. From then on the story spins off and touches aspects of international terrorism, rogue CIA agents and British secrets. I would expect no less from Steven Moffat and, in his own style he keeps us interested in a thickening, complicated plot.

The biggest challenge for this season would have been to move the characters forward rather than simply solve cases. In this episode certainly we see a more human side of Sherlock which speaks to the audience and I can’t praise Benedict Cumberbatch enough for his acting. Robert Downey Jr. ought to take some pointers. The inclusion of Lara Pulver to play Irene Adler was brilliant in its own right. And of course, sex sells. So, it was not surprising at all that the episode had a 30% audience share. Yet the show itself was not trashed and the upcoming series finale is certainly worth looking forward to.

There has been much to look forward to in this series, with last Sunday’s episode revolving around the famous hell-hound case, which received an army research labs twist. In particular the upcoming series finale is one to watch out for as the detective finally tackles his greatest antagonist: Jim Moriarty. Sir Conan Doyle didn’t think Sherlock would make it out of this one alive. Will 21st Century Sherlock make it? I guess you’ll just have to tune in.
