During the past week the Felix website has seen some of its highest activity ever, as various members of College have taken to our [comment boards](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/2032/clayponds-in-crisis/#commentHeader) to voice their opinions over last week’s report on the potential closure of Clayponds. Demonstrating that the postgraduate voice at Imperial is very much alive and well, it shows that adjustments to college life are not solely exclusive to one section of Imperial’s community, but rather everyone.

Even considering this, undergraduates may be wondering why they should care about postgraduate accommodation, especially if they have no intention of pursuing a postgraduate education. It is unwise to continue through an academic career at Imperial without awareness of the decisions that college takes on important issues such as Clayponds or [the Holland Club](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/1972/staff-and-students-rally-around-holland-club-campaign/), and the effects that it has on other hugely significant areas of college life. There can easily be repercussions from postgraduates to undergraduates across the college, as, obviously, the student body is not rigidly divided.

Needless to say, Felix will report on these issues and bring them to the attention of Imperial, especially when bodies such as the Union are incensed at what they believe to be a lack of communication on the part of the college. It is important to remember that Imperial is not only made up of undergraduates, nor solely postgraduates. Not every major story will revolve around one particular area of college. The fact that there have been so many comments from those affected by the Clayponds story cements the fact that news has a reach across the entirety of Imperial.

Comments will continue to be made on upcoming stories as term unfolds. Consider your own input into the stories that affect you and ensure that you are aware. After all, as you are no doubt reminded, it’s not all about academia here. Make the most of your Imperial experience and understand what is happening around you.

Herein lies the point: exercise your right to respond to articles online, and in doing so keep the stories that matter to you at the forefront of college life. Consider writing a comment article for this very paper about an issue that you find important. Whether Imperial-related or not, free opinion and expression are at the forefront of this paper.
