Last week I bet £500 at 2:1 that the next American president will be Donald Trump. And if Hillary Clinton doesn’t sort out her campaign strategy fast, he will win a landslide victory.

When Trump initially announced his campaign, he was a joke candidate – how could he, a man who had previously claimed to be a Democrat, have a hope of getting the Republican nomination?

Once in the race, his objective was to obtain attention quickly, which he achieved with an array of insulting statements and ‘bold’ policies. Of Mexican immigrants, he said; “They’re bringing drugs, crime. They’re rapists.” He pledged to build a wall along the southern border and to “make Mexico pay for it”, and he called for a shutdown on Muslim immigration.

All of this is preposterous, there’s no doubt. But that didn’t matter. At this stage he wasn’t trying to be electable, he was merely trying to get noticed- and noticed he got. In the following months he received over $2billion worth of free media attention. When his ratings went up, he used this attention to let everybody know. And somehow it got better for Trump – people actually bought into his ideas. With every controversial statement he made, thousands praised him for speaking his mind, for challenging political correctness. The American right-wing was more stupid than anyone thought.

He had everything he needed: huge attention and huge popularity. It seemed only a matter of time until the nomination was secured. People tuned in to the debates purely to watch him – he became the man who stood up for the silent majority. He had convinced millions that they wanted America to be great again, whatever that means.

His story couldn’t be more different from that of career politician Clinton. At the start of the Democratic race, it was pretty much assumed that she would win.

Her leading opposition was hardcore leftie Bernie Sanders, a candidate who was initially dismissed as being unelectable on account of his socialist policies. His campaign is largely about getting big money out of politics, and emphasising the need for a non-establishment president. Along with Trump, he has made the presidential election all about fighting the status quo.

Clinton’s reaction has been peculiar. Instead of emphasising the need for someone with experience and knowledge rather than an outsider, she decided to desperately insist that she’s not part of the establishment. Her reason? She’s a woman! She is trusted by neither the left nor the right. The left thinks she’s controlled by the big banks and corporations who funded her campaign and career, the right thinks she’s responsible for the Benghazi attacks and would never vote for her because of her liberal stances on issues like abortion.

She’s been associated with scandal and corruption her whole political life, including her private email account currently under investigation by the FBI, with 30,000 ‘accidentally’ deleted emails presumed to have contained information about the Benghazi attacks. Trump is already referring to her as "Crooked Hillary”, and will push this until November.

It’s clear that she knows more about almost every issue that could come up. However, in the debates, he will crush her. Trump has shown that to win a debate you don’t need to know anything about anything as long as you can talk.

He will move categorically to the left in order to pick up votes from the currently undecided. Already we have seen him abandon his destructive foreign policy, saying in April that “the power of weaponry is the single biggest problem in the world”. This will be effective because his Republican fans on the whole don’t care about policy – as long as he remains The Donald he’ll have their undying support.

His early campaign was very insulting to Mexicans and Muslims who had little impact in the Republican primaries. In May he acknowledged that his numbers among Hispanics were a big problem, but said “I have two more people [Rubio and Cruz] to get rid of...once I start on Hillary you’ll see those numbers change.” This shows that he will dramatically change his rhetoric now that he’s won the Republican vote.

The way the two presumptive candidates are already running their respective presidential campaigns is very telling. Trump wants to Make America Great Again while Hillary wants to be the first female president. To the uninformed voter I know which one of those sounds more appealing. She will resort to project fear. Already on her website the first thing that pops up is “We can’t risk a Donald Trump presidency”. Her campaign will be entirely anti-Trump, and as dangerous as a Trump presidency would be, negative politics will never resonate as well as Trump’s Make America Great Again philosophy has, especially given how bad a communicator Clinton is.

To clarify, I think Trump is abhorrent. He’s the least prepared presidential candidate of all time and would be the worst thing to ever happen to America. If I could, I would vote against him. He is marmite, and I concede that not a tonne of Americans are fans of marmite. But Hillary is out-of-date marmite. Americans have shown that to them, policy just doesn’t matter as much as personality, and unless Clinton makes radical changes to her campaign strategy, she’ll make this a race between Trump and please-God-not-Trump. It’ll be all about The Donald.
