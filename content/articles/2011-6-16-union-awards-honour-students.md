Winners of this year’s Union awards were announced on Monday at the final Union Council meeting of the academic year.

The awards recognise those working across the Union, from clubs and societies to representation, with a belief that ‘those who have gone over and above what is expected of them should be recognised.’

Of the 109 individuals nominated for awards, (consisting of Colours, Outstanding Services Awards and Union Fellowships) 80 were decided to have met the necessary criteria to receive an award.

At the Council meeting, special praise was reserved by Union President Alex Kendall for two award winning individuals.

Kendall commended Dan Wan, who has received an Outstanding Services Award, for his role in publicising and helping to organise December’s Life Sciences protests.

Additionally, Fellowship winner Nathaniel Bottrell was lauded for his extensive work in Union minibus training, with Kendall claiming that trips requiring the use of vehicles could not have gone ahead without him helping individuals to become approved drivers.

Christopher Birkett and Jenny Wilson received the highest accolade possible, a Fellowship with Distinction, thereby being deemed by the Union to have made ‘an innovative development to the work of the Union such as to leave a positive legacy that will make a lasting impression for future members.’
