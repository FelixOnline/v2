Babar Ahmad is a British Citizen and former student and staff member of [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk) who has been detained in prison for eight years under anti-terrorist legislation without a trial in the UK. He has been battling against extradition to the US but on 10 April the [European Court of Human Rights](http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en)[approved](http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int///////tkp197/portalhbkm.asp?sessionId=95024221&skin=hudoc-pr-en&action=request&poll=6#) the decision for him to be extradited within the next three months where he may be subjected to solitary confinement in a ‘Supermax’ prison.

The family of Babar Ahmad have promised to fight his extradition “to the end” and admitted that they were “[very disappointed](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17664044)” by the court’s decision. They are determined to seek proper justice and ensure that Babar should be put on trial in the UK, along with a full public inquiry into his case. His father stated that the British justice “appears to have been subcontracted to the US”. Amna Ahmad, Babar Ahmad’s sister, has raised concerns about her brother’s mental health, saying, “there’s only so much a person in that condition could do.”

However, The European Court of Human Rights said that he would not be subject to “ill-treatment” in the US. The judges said that the US authorities are “justified” in treating convicted terrorists as a “significant security risk” and are therefore allowed to limit their communications with the outside world.

In an [interview](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17627107) with the BBC conducted at Long Lartin Prison in early April, Babar Ahmad gave his own views on his detainment. He told the BBC: “I have never been questioned about the allegations against me. I have never been shown the evidence against me.” Babar Ahmad urged the Director of Public Prosecutions to put him on trial in the UK to find out what has gone wrong with his case.

In the campaign to free Babar Ahmad, an official government online petition was created to generate support against his extradition and was signed by over 140,000 people. There was enough support for the petition to be taken the House of Commons to be debated. On 30 March, the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee released a report that [concluded](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17553860) that the US-UK Extradition Treaty should be amended to deal with the unease of the fairness of the Treaty.

Scotland Yard released a statement, which said: “The Metropolitan Police Service carried out their investigation strictly in accordance with UK law. This process involved close liaison with the Crown Prosecution Service. We completely reject any suggestion of impropriety.” They also stated, “All extradition requests made to the United Kingdom are subject to the Extradition Act and any other relevant legislation. The CPS acts as the representative of the requesting judicial authority in extradition proceedings.”

Additionally, James Loy, the former US Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security said, “This is a new realm, this is a new era that demands international co-operation associated with crimes that have international implications. The Ahmad case is that case.”

Amna Ahmad and the rest of Babar Ahmad’s family will continue with their [Free Babar Ahmad Campaign](http://www.freebabarahmad.com/). Amna Ahmad said, “We’re not afraid of a trial. We’re not afraid of him being charged with anything. We’re actually asking for that. So that he can have an opportunity to see the allegations, to see the evidence, to be questioned in an open court of law with a jury of his peers.”
