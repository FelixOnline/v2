On the evening of Friday 8th February, the Union Concert Hall was filled with a lively audience for the greatly anticipated annual Imperial College Charity Fashion Show: _Luna, Terra, Sol_. Sponsored by Godiva and organised by the Fashion and Design Society in collaboration with ICU RAG, the event brought together models, dancers, singers, designers and an enthusiastic audience in a whirlwind evening of entertainment.

First on was Polish designer Karol Cygan’s collection, his bold and futuristic designs setting a modern and exciting tone for the show. Next up was the latest Appareal collection, designed by Olesya Nazarova, with sleek and mysterious moon-grey outfits, tailored for the 21st century woman. The brand prioritises sustainability, using recycled fabrics and crafting the collection in solar-powered factories. After a quick change, our models were back wearing An Original Leroy, designed by Natasha Wright, in bold and unapologetic neon prints, paired with strangely charming Escape the Cloud laser-cut jewellery by Imperial student designer Olivia Gallupova.

After a vibrant performance from Imperial’s Belly Dancing Society, the second act kicked off with the Ardill Larosi contemporary menswear collection, followed by Kashida’s outerwear collection, pairing earthy coloured jackets with simply embroidered scarves. Student-led movement SolidariTee finished the Terra segment of the show, whose shirts raise support for refugees and whose profits go towards legal aid in Greece.

Onto the final section of the show; fashion guru Nuno Lopes De Olivieria flies in from Macau for his second collection at Imperial College Charity Fashion Show. Inspired by the gas giant Jupiter, where it rains diamonds, the models glittered their way down the catwalk in Nuno’s latest collection. Featured in British and Italian Vogue, designer Nuno told _Felix_ that his current work is partly inspired by the increasing popularity of online make-up tutorials, with colours inspired by eyeshadows. The event closed with lingerie, notably the Made by Ava collection, of which each item was handmade.

Not only did the event celebrate fashion and design, but all profits will support three deserving charities, namely The El Salvador Project, The National Autistic Society and, finally, Doctors without Borders, where efforts are being focussed on the current humanitarian crisis in Yemen. The show closed with some moving thank you’s from organisers Marianne Gazet and Izabella Higson, who extended their thanks to all who contributed, from the make-up artists and photographers, to the models who spent hours rehearsing and to the DramSoc team behind the scenes. A sleek and sparkly event for a good cause, this year’s Fashion Show was certainly a memorable occasion.
