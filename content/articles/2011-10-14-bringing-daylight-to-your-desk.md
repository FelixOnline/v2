Daylight’s Foldi LED Lamp is exactly what it says on the tin. A desktop lamp featuring 30 LEDs to produce up to 1500 lux, the Foldi both dresses to impress and performs. Once you put in the batteries or plug it in using the supplied USB cable, you open up the Foldi and it immediately produces brilliantly bright light. It has green credentials too, claiming it uses 90% less energy than conventional bulbs. That’s not all the Foldi has going for it though. Its name comes from the fact that it compacts itself when not in use. Open it up to get the lights themselves in the top part, and a stand in the bottom. So it will stay upright on a flat surface – perfect for desk use. So while the Foldi does perform well and is a quality product, it’s not quite perfect. It seems large for what it is, and is pricey at £69.99. And when it’s tethered to your computer, I don’t know what it will light that your monitor won’t. But if you’re looking for a portable desk lamp, you could do worse than the Foldi.
