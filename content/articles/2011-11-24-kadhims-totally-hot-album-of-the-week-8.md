 -  Ill look at a few tracksWhen pepole are looking for real theological exegesis they dont look to the Newsboys Most lyrics explore a simple Bible concept I really think Taits voice is killing it on this album  On Your Knees  is really good but sounds a lot like a Daughtry or Lifehouse ballad but it is done so well in the same way that dc Talk would copy another artists style and it would still sound good He makes some statement about  love coming from the inside out  but ultimately this song runs in contrast to the message of Rick Warren basically saying  when youve given it all you got  which the message should be  why arent you first going to Scripture and prayer  that submitting to God is how to survive and at times overcome When The Boys Light Up  sounds a little like a Toby Mac song and I wouldnt mind this which is yet another inspirational  go get  em  song but the guitars keys and drums are just a little cheesy The little phrases like  get wired to the Highest Power   we a

Searching out new music is not a lone pursuit and cannot be meaningfully automated. You can’t hope to get past the tripe on mainstream radio or last.fm’s “1+1 = U2” algorithm without a friend giving you a nudge and saying, “we literally won’t be friends anymore if you don’t love this band”.

There’s a lot of music out there. Enough to fill your ears a million times over for the rest of your days. As a single intrepid soul, you can’t possibly listen to enough music to filter the bad from the good. Music websites/blogs/magazines do most of the work for you; just as I’m hopefully doing in this column every week. But even then, you need to be terminally unemployed to keep up with all the music that a site like [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com) sends at you.

Ultimately you’re most likely to find an album you love the new-fashioned way: a friend posting music on your Facebook wall. Which brings me to [_808s & Dark Grapes II_](http://mishkanyc.bandcamp.com/album/main-attrakionz-808s-dark-grapes-ii) by __Main Attrakionz__. If you listened to [__A$AP Rocky__ last week](http://felixonline.co.uk/music/1776/kadhims-totally-hot-album-of-the-week-7/) (which I know you all did) and thought “I’m gonna need some more of this” (which I know you all did) then Main Attrakionz is the heroin to your addiction. This is forward-thinking, groovy hip-hop; this is late-night, bedroom music; this is a roll-your-shoulders-and-shake-your-head-in-public album.

_Jamie Fraser, who was kind enough to recommend this album, sadly doesn’t have Twitter. So say “Cheers” to his Scottish namesake instead [@JamieFraser](https://twitter.com/#!/jamiefraser). Better still, tweet [@JamieFraserFan](https://twitter.com/#!/jamiefraserfan) and tell her hip-hop didn’t die in the 90s._
