[This week](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/8938812/Universities-should-not-be-run-for-profit.html) professors from various institutions across the UK outlined their fears regarding the higher education [White Paper](http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/hereform/white-paper/) in a letter, in particular highlighting a perceived move that the Paper could lead to: a US-style higher education private sector that would see for-profit companies becoming able to acquire struggling universities. Claiming that one of the negative consequences of such a move would be “crushing levels of debt”, the conclusion that the academics have reached deserves at least some analysis, especially considering the ongoing debt situation that graduates already face.

Critics may initially point out that the letter is simply a knee-jerk reaction to the changes outlined by the White Paper by academics unwilling to adapt to the creation of a form of higher education market, a market that would be responsive to the needs of the student and would potentially lead to far more dynamic changes than we see at present. However, studying the grievances of the professors further sees significant worry towards an American system of for-profit business.

However, there is always a possibility that the private sector could allow universities access to greater resources than we can find at present. After all, alumni fundraising at UK universities pales significantly in comparison to institutions in the US. Help from the private sector, despite danger from the shareholder, could be immeasurably more profitable than at present.

Another comment that the academics make concerns the fact that a move towards a higher education private sector would see a heavy burden on the taxpayer, as well as the indebted student. Yet the taxpayer, as we are reminded by the past government-subsided system and fierce critics of the proposals of the current government, currently foots the bill for university degrees across the country.

We are heading inexorably towards £9,000 fees next year. For better or for worse, and whatever your own personal opinion on the government’s proposals, we will begin to at least have a better idea of the new worth of a degree under our current system once the new intake of students begin next year. Concerned academics such as those who signed the letter to _The Daily Telegraph_ will likely have to wait and see whether the new fees will lead to an American system. At the very least, we must have faith in the current system and the focus on financial support that we continue to enjoy.
