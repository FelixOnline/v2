Professor Ian Owens, the current head of the Department of Life Sciences, has been announced as the Natural History Museum’s new Director of Science.

In his new role, Professor Owens will be responsible for setting the strategic direction of its scientific activities and taking responsibility for the collections of over 70 million scientific specimens from around the world.

Professor Owens [attracted controversy earlier this year](http://felixonline.co.uk/search/?q=ian+owens&sa=) for his role in the the restructure of Life Sciences. The restructure faced [fierce opposition and protests](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/530/staff-and-students-rail-against-job-cuts-/) from the Union and students.

The Natural History Museum has expressed its “delight” at Owens’ appointment, remarking that, “Ian’s leadership will give our progress greater momentum.”

Union President Alex Kendall wished Professor Owens well in his new job and acknowledged that despite their differences in the past year, “[Professor Owens] remained courteous and polite throughout, where others may have not.”

Professor Maggie Dallman, Head of the Faculty of Natural Sciences, wishes “warm congratulations” towards Professor Owens, adding that, “thanks to his careful and professional leadership, the Department of Life Sciences is in an excellent position to grow and develop.”

Responding to his appointment, Professor Owens has highlighted the connection between the College and the Museum.

“In my new role I hope to strengthen the relationship between Imperial and the Museum…working together I hope we can do even more to inspire the public and tackle major challenges in natural sciences.”

Professor Owens, who has served as Head of Department since 2007, is expected to embark on his new appointment in the autumn while maintaining affiliation with the College. The selection process for his successor is ongoing.
