He is also a No.1 best selling author, he has sold more than two million books worldwide and he is the patron of the independent British-registered charity The Kasiisi Porridge Project which gives rural schoolchildren living near the Kibale National Park in western Uganda a meal every day. He is Ainsley Harriot.

__What has been more exciting and fulfilling for you, being a TV star, an author, or a chef?__

I love the idea of diversifying – it’s lovely to be able to do other things if opportunities arise along the way. I’ve been very lucky and have to say I love all three. We do get influenced by our parents whether we like it or not and my dad was an international entertainer and my mum was a great cook, so the two careers walk hand in hand to me.

__You have written an enormous amount of unique and delicious recipes. From where do you usually get the inspiration?__

Inspiration comes from my late mum, Graham Kerr (The Galloping Gourmet) and the relationships I have built up with people along the way. Hearing other people’s ideas and experiences is really stimulating and can only influence my cooking further.

__Ainsley Harriott products are famous for their taste and quality. What is your personal involvement in their production?__

I work with the development team at Symington’s. We take inspiration from all over the world and then test and retest until we’re happy with the result. It’s a long process but we’d rather take our time and get it right. Every product is tested by me, often several times, but I also hand them out to a couple of close friends to see what they think of them before I finally sign them off.

__If you had to choose one of your products as being your favourite, which one would it be?__

I love the cous cous - and I’m really excited about the new sauce mixes that you’ll see next year. It’s a tough question though. I tend to like whatever I’m working on at the time.

__What do you think is the most common pitfall in cooking?__

People not being prepared before they start.

__Imperial College students have a very tight schedule, so many sometime choose fast food. Do you have any suggestions to encourage them to lead a healthier life?__

Well obviously my products are pretty fast and they aren’t high in fat – so go and buy a risotto! There are loads of speedy recipes out there. There really isn’t an excuse to be unhealthy just because you don’t have much time.

__What should we expect from Ainsley Harriott in 2012?__

A new chicken recipe book early in the New Year, loads of new product launches and a little investigation into the wonders of the British pea.
