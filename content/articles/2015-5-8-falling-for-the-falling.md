_The Falling_ is written and directed by Carol Morley, whose first feature film was the moving docudrama, _Dreams of a Life_.

Set in 1969, _The Falling_ centres on a bizarre fainting epidemic at an English girls school.

Although this is a fictional account, there are records of similar episodes throughout history and Morley based this drama on such events.

Maisie Williams (_Game of Thrones_) plays Lydia Lambert, the confused and angry teenage girl at the heart of the outbreak.

Talented newcomer, Florence Pugh, is Lydia’s charismatic and precocious best-friend, Abigail Mortimer.

Whether for a modest skirt length or meticulous punctuality to lessons, rules at the girls’ school are tyrannically enforced.

This is not an environment tolerant of mass hysteria. Most of the scenes are quiet and intense, hinting at repressed emotions that could surface at any time. Lydia clearly adores Abbie and there is a suggestion of lesbianism to their relationship.

However, it’s not just the students with hidden depths: one of Morley’s many strengths is that she writes her minor characters with the same care that she would give her protagonists.

Greta Scacchi gives a confident performance as Lydia and Abbie’s snarling form tutor; and the wonderful Maxine Peake plays Lydia’s affectionless mother.

The spooky and downbeat film score is composed by Tracey Thorn, of Everything But the Girl.

The instrumentation is sparse, mainly relying on acoustic guitar, a low, clear singing voice, and the kind of instruments you might find in a school music lesson.

The result is a soundtrack that doesn’t intrude on the drama, signposting what will happen next; it is a part of the atmosphere itself, heightening the action at times, but not afraid to lapse into silence.

_The Falling_ is a great accomplishment by Morley. It’s odd and disturbing, exploring themes of repression, sexual curiosity and the grey areas between what is and is not real.

The performances are engaging, particularly from Pugh and Williams; and the scenery is beautifully shot, the country landscapes looking like paintings.

There’s nothing else like _The Falling_ in cinemas at the moment so don’t miss out. It’s a haunting film which will stay with you for days after you’ve watched it.
