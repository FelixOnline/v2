The grand opening of the exhibition in the [Blyth Gallery](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/arts/visualart/blythgallery) at 6pm on Wednesday is open to everyone. There’ll be free wine, nibbles and a chance to meet the talented artists and talk to them about the works. The theme ‘Wreckage’ is explored through five large scale installations which have been put together by collaborations of artists, and contributions from individual members of the society on the theme.

On entry to the exhibition to the Blyth Gallery, the attendees will be met by a floor-to-ceiling ‘infinite sculpture‘ of parallel mirrors twisting the replicated image to destruction. The next large sculpture in the sequence will show the imminence of predicted disaster, as a huge red balloon is suspended above its destiny of explosion. This theme of progress from existence to wreckage and rebirth is followed to its final conclusion, when all that is left for the rebirth is the hopes of the survivors.

After months of preparation, both in [Leosoc’s](http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/arts/leonardo/) own studio in the basement of Beit, and by members at home, it will be exciting to see the ambitious project finally come together.

The exhibit will be open for the rest of week after the opening on Wednesday so you can drop in anytime on level five of the Sherfield Building.

For the inspired, other Leosoc activities throughout the rest of term include Monday evening sessions on watercolour, life drawing and rooftop landscape drawing. Photosoc, who co-produced [Untethered](http://felixonline.co.uk/arts/912/untethered/) will unveil their own exhibition on the 16th March.
