It is reported that at some point last week there was a fire in the Huxley building, which is home to both the Mathematics and Computing departments.

In an e-mail sent to students in the Computing Department last Friday; the College said, “An incident was recently reported of a cigarette butt causing a fire in a bin located on level 2 of Huxley building, in front of the Clore lecture theatre. Please be reminded that smoking is not permitted in front of any of the entrances to Huxley or on the walkway to Sherfield building.” The Fire Officer was not available for a comment.
