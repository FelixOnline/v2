It’s a fairly eventful week in the most recent, unfortunately weaker, episode of _Game of Thrones_. Right off the bat, we’re treated to perhaps one of the biggest reveals in the series; the origin of the White Walkers. The problems start here, because this scene sorely lacks the gravitas it requires and as a result has nowhere near the impact that it should. The fact that it just sort of happens, out of nowhere, doesn’t help.

Perhaps if it was done a bit later in the series, with more time dedicated to it and more questions answered it would’ve felt weightier. In its defence, however, there were a few interesting things to be noticed in this scene. In particular, one of the Weirwoods having a serious case of Max Von Sydnow face and the fact that it is spring this far north. In retrospect, this also raises some further interesting questions about the nature of the Walkers, but, at the time, I was underwhelmed.

Funnily enough, my favourite moments of the episode were the relatively low-key ones. Jorah and Dany’s reunion and prompt re-separation was fantastic. This was narratively a great place for Jorah’s arc to go and, honestly, I wouldn’t mind too much even if this was its end. But, I don’t think we’re quite done with him just yet (crazy theory time: Jorah will end up meeting Arya/the Faceless Men given their and Greyscale’s mutual links to the Doom of Valyria).

All things considered, it was nice to see the Andal finally admit his feelings out loud, and accept his fate. Equally, it felt well-earned to have Dany finally acknowledge how much she values his friendship and would be impacted by his loss. The scene had beautiful pangs of finality and regret, thanks in no small part to Emilia Clarke’s excellent performance. It further serves to make her realise the folly of arrogant tendencies; having potentially driven one of her closest friends to his death. Dany, for better or worse, takes the world for what she wants it to be rather than what it is; reflected in her desperate order to Jorah to find a cure for himself, instead of a heartfelt goodbye.

Finally, there is the great tragedy of Hodor; his life ruined just so that he could die alone in the cold, screaming, and so far from home. The death itself was unusually poetic and heroic for the series. Though, to me, the origin of the name felt incredibly cheesy. Poor Willis’ fate at the hands of Bran ties back into the Children’s creation of the Walkers; a grim reminder that in war, even the ‘good guys’ can’t stay good for very long. Oh yeah, and the Kingsmoot happened; but you can tell how shit that was by how little I’ve mentioned it.

_Game of Thrones is available on HBO Go_
