His sister is always busy
 got to keep to time
 time is the law
 tick tock.
 His sister has no plants
 inorganic sleek
 smooth, straight, safe
 she used to carry the stream things
 like he did
 zip zap
 they are flies, filthy flies
 zap zip
 every night, waiting on every street corner.

Architects made them twins
 one fell
 out of glamour
 out of order
 out of use
 fingers no longer roll
 over his torso
 seek his waist
 rain disfigures him
 peels off the skin
 disintegrate, degenerate, deteriorate
 yet he is found by me
 he is more than his sister.

I love him.
