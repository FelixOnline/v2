Just like oil and water...

Perhaps we should remain separate.
 There is that permanent impermeable membrane
 That lies between Ying and Yang
 Preventing them from meeting half way;
 Mixing, and becoming grey...

These iron wrought manacles of fear that fastened our pride
 Disassembled, and reconstituted our minds.
 The same iron drilled through the earth
 The centre cannot hold: Things Fall apart

You see, a glorious warrior nation was pacified
 Their men of valour and chiefs made to cower undignified
 We were made captives in our own land
 Slapped and rejected at each attempt to voice our opinion or merely raise our hand
 Our laws were no longer our own
 Each person made to answer to the district judge - a man he’d never known
 The old ways are gone and things fall apart.

(The power of the oil drills) Its power quakes beneath our feet;
 The mighty tremble.
 The earth’s kernel is ripe to bursting; it oozes black blood.
 Its abundance is harvested by the reapers
 With scythes tainted by malice and greed
 That marks our ground,
 The same blades used to mark our graves.

The oil drills caused the earth to shake
 Our polluted rivers and land lay raped
 Fishermen can’t fish in a dead oil lagoon
 But a young boy still looks up to ask his father –Why- there is –no- food
 So we’d had enough.
 So we thought we’d make a stand
 And arise as a people take the law into our own hands
 But who would have known?
 The drillers paid off our government, to catch us in our sleep
 Peppered bullets across the sky, and this is why my black blood leaks

Why do I merely subsist in this physiologically imposed periphery?

Double edge!

Of supposed oil riches forgone
 And empty sovereign wealth funds

Why do you mock us?
 Although we claim to wield you,
 Pressing against us your merciless claw detaches
 Seam from seam marrow from marrow;
 The dry bones are scattered

But who will gather them up?
