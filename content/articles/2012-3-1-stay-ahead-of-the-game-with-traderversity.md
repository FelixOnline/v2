     Did your editor know you were providing free advertising, adding no new content to a press release?,Is it plagiarism when an article such as this one is copied word-for-word from an earlier article (27/01/12)?? <br> <br>http://www.easier.com/98760-students-stay-ahead-game-traderversity.html, It's a press release and I had full acknowledgment from Chris hobcroft one of the guys behind making traderversity and it's owner company copper dime.... <br>,Yes, I informed them it was a press release. So it was completely up to the editor to post this article and clearly they thought it was fit for the section in felix.,I hope Felix got paid for this "article".

Traderversity is an exciting new, free, virtual trading game designed exclusively for UK university students. The interactive online game at [www.traderversity.com](http://www.traderversity.com) lets students try their hand at trading with real-time access to the stock market without investing any real money. Creating healthy competition, players can get to grips with the basics of trading, interact with other student traders and be in with the chance to win a share of the £5,000 monthly prize fund!

Traderversity is the world’s only free, no-risk financial trading game with real-time prices. Quick to register and easy to use, simply log in via Facebook and a valid university email address and once registered players can start buying and selling Equities, Currencies, Commodities, and building their portfolio.

Designed to help de-mystify “The City”, the game can be used by students from all academic fields, from economics and finance, through to arts, sciences and humanities. Students can experience the thrill of the trade with Traderversity’s live games, competitions and step-by-step learning tutorials, and can share tips and advice with other players on what to invest in and when.

Traderversity provides a risk-free chance to play the stock markets without investing any real money. Over 1000 students from 87 universities across the UK have registered so far and 300 of these have won real cash prizes already!

Traderversity is currently running two competitions where students can win one of five iPad2s or a share of £5,000. The top 50 players at the end of the month will be entered into a draw and the first five names chosen at random will each win an iPad2 16Gb Wi-Fi. In addition, there is £1,000 of real cash up for grabs every week with a top prize of £250, and the top 50 all winning cash prizes.

On registering, players are awarded £1m of virtual money to use to enter live trading competitions where profits and losses contribute to the overall leaderboard. Players can go head-to-head with friends and contacts using the website’s in-built Facebook widget, as well as against other players in the wider Traderversity league. Students also represent their universities in the overall university league, which tracks the universities with the best trading talent. And with talent in mind, Traderversity works closely with leading investment firms, so students displaying trading finesse might catch the eye of industry headhunters or future employers!

Two London-based businessmen, Jonathan Rose and Chris Hobcroft, devised the game based on their own experiences in trading, financial services and technology. Between them, they have 15 years’ experience in the trading, financial services and technology sectors. Jonathan says: “We looked at the trading games on offer and we saw that nothing was tailored specifically to students. We saw only over-simplified and boring alternatives, or those that didn’t reflect the reality of what was truly happening on the market.
