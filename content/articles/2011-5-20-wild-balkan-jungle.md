The idea behind Outlook Festival is straightforward: a large number of people; an 18th century fort; a strictly UK-Jamaican bass and dub sound; beach parties; boat parties and, if you need it, a coach named “The Sunshine Bus” to get you from England to Croatia.

The festival, surely the best way of rounding off the summer, takes place between the 1st and 4th of September. The line up is ridiculous (in a very good way), combining both established old-timers and relative newcomers from the scenes of dubstep, garage, dnb, jungle, dub-reggae and grime. Expect to see Jamie XX, Ramadanman, Untold, Girl Unit, MJ Cole, Hudson Mohawke, Bok Bok, Skream, Benga, Marcus Nasty, Newham Generals, El-B, Shy FX, Barrington Levy, Channel One Sound System, Congo Natty, David Rodigan and Gentleman’s Dub Club to name but a few. Think of it as FWD’s back catalogue meets Channel AKA when it was still called Channel U with a bit of Notting Hill Carnival thrown in for good measure.

Outlook has been running since 2008 and has grown considerably each year. If you want to sample it while it is still a relatively intimate affair then now is certainly your best bet. The first batch of tickets have sold out but festival organisers are considering the release of a second batch so get yourself to www.outlookfestival.com and keep your finger on the F5 button. For anyone that doesn’t know that’s how you refresh the page using the keyboard (big up the computing department crew inside, I know you’re feeling that one).
