Mango is a staple summer fruit that is bound to zing up any dish you add it to, and black rice is no exception. This dish is literally explosive with flavour, and you’re not going to want to miss it, especially when all you have to do is mix all the ingredients together in a bowl!

- 2 cups forbidden black rice, cooked and cooled
- 1 1/2 cups ripe mango chunks
- 1 cup cucumbers, finely chopped
- 1/2 cup red bell pepper, finely chopped
- 1/2 cup red onion, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
- 1 tablespoon jalapeno peppers, chopped
- 1 tablespoon mint leaves, chopped
- 1 teaspoon lime zest
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- 1 teaspoon salt

**Sheet Pan Chili Lime Salmon**

Bursting with zesty flavours from the limes, and the perfect smokiness from the peppers, this dish is perfect for a quick and easy dinner dish after a long day.

- 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lime juice (or juice of 2 limes)
- 1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic (or 4 crushed garlic cloves)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons red chilli flakes 
- 1 teaspoon ground Cumin
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 4 salmon fillets (wild caught if possible)
- 1 red, 1 green and 1 yellow bell pepper (capsicum), deseeded and chopped
- 1 onion, cut into wedges

_How to:_

1. Whisk lime juice, parsley, olive oil, water, garlic, chilli flakes, cumin, salt and parsley together to combine. Add the honey and whisk again until the honey runs smooth through the rest of the ingredients. Arrange the salmon fillets, peppers and onion in a single layer on the prepared baking tray; and pour over half of the marinade
1. Broil / grill until the peppers are just beginning to char at the edges (about 10 minutes) and the salmon is cooked to your liking (about 10 minutes). Remove from the oven and serve immediately with lime wedges and remaining marinade for added flavour.
