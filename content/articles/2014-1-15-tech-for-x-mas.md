#### Samsung KN55S9C OLED TV

If you’ve ever thought that HD pictures were not enough, fear no more, the Samsung OLED TV that uses organic self-emitting pixels would blow your mind away this Christmas giving you the best quality, surpassing even the best LCD TVs. This TV doesn’t come cheap, expect to be paying an average price of nine grand, however if you consider the price per pixel it almost makes it worth it!

#### Archipod

This little beauty beats your average shed, that’s for sure, if you fancy chilling in your garden this Christmas but want to keep warm in this cosy pod with its inbuilt fiberglass insulation you wont be disappointed.

We all know how Bruce Wayne dines in style from his Stately Wayne Manor, but where does he watch movies? In his bat-cave of course, and now theatre designer Elite Home Theatre seating is offering the chance to share the same experience for a staggering $2 million but would sure be worth it if you have the spare cash this Christmas especially when it t’is the season… where the best movies come out on TV
