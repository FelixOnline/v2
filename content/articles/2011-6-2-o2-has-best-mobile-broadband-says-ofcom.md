Looking to switch mobile connections and can’t go without a regular dose of Facebook and Twitter? [Ofcom’s latest report](http://media.ofcom.org.uk/2011/05/27/mobile-broadband-speeds-revealed/) would suggest that you head to your nearest O2 store. The company came out on top in a study of major mobile providers in the UK, loading pages faster than any of 3, Vodafone, Orange or T-Mobile. The latter two, part of the ‘Everything Everywhere’ partnership, performed the worst in the study with speeds that were roughly half that of O2. The research might not mean much in London however, as it was carried out throughout the UK – even ‘in the M62 corridor between Manchester and Liverpool’, where it is safe to assume there are few Imperial students during term time. With smartphone uptake on the rise throughout the UK, O2 might just be as ‘better, connected’ as they claim.
