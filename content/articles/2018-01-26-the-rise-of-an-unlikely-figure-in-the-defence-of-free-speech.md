There is absolutely no doubt that free speech at universities in the UK and the US has hit a low point. There is an obsession with keeping students in their safe spaces in order to be protected from any kind of ideas which they might find offensive. This strategy makes sense. It is, after all, the easy path to take. UC Berkeley took the hard path and had to spend about 600,000$ on security for an event in which conservative speaker Ben Shapiro was to speak. A similar free speech problem is found here in the UK, which is probably why (now ex-minister) Jo Johnson had called out universities and threatened them with fines over their so called “non-platforming policies”. 

Students are being protected from ideas that are not their own, and this is creating a culture akin to the protective parent who doesn’t let his children play outside for fear of getting sick. They don’t develop a response mechanism to deal with outside threats, and this isolation has greatly contributed to the rise of Trump and Brexit. The left was so isolated from the rest of the world that real discussion with the other side happened less, not more. After years of this kind of isolation, any kind of concern about immigration was not discussed, but dismissed as racism; the concerns of white working-class men were largely ignored while their incomes stagnated, their employability decreased and their life expectancy declined. It makes perfect sense that right-wing populists would fill that gap of concern that the left was never ready to even begin to address. 

In light of this crisis of dialogue an unlikely “hero” of the defence of free speech has arrived: University of Toronto’s in-house public intellectual Jordan Peterson. A clinical psychologist by training, this professor gained notoriety after a viral video in which he was seen arguing with trans activists over the use of their pronouns. He blatantly opposed laws in Canada promoting compulsory use of trans pronouns and became popular after that by attending talk shows in defence of free speech. With over 600K followers on YouTube, where he has uploaded a large amount of lectures, he has become an internet personality. 

In order to understand his approach to the defence of free speech, I recommend watching his recent heated interview with Channel 4’s Cathy Newman, which he did in his visit to the UK to promote his new book. The key moment came when asked why his right to free speech should trump a trans persons right not to be offended. He replied: “In order to be able to think, you have to risk being offensive. Look at the conversation we’re having. You’re willing to risk offending me in the pursuit of truth. Why should you be able to do that? It’s making me pretty uncomfortable.” This response pretty much sums up what he thinks about the issue.

This follows on, however, on from his critique on the culture of victimisation that stems out from identity politics. It’s interesting how he takes on questions on supposed “oppression by the existing social structure of the western patriarchy”. He argues that dominance hierarchies are not social constructs, but biological realities that evolution hardwired into our minds, as lobsters, which separated our evolution trajectory about 350million years ago, also have these structures.

While his popularity rose, a lot of his work came to light, revealing a much deeper (and potentially less controversial) part of his thinking. You discover good practical advice from a psychologist combined with theoretical, pseudo-intellectual grandiose ideas which could potentially pass as philosophy. I loved how he explained the origins of the concept of sacrifice: you’d think primitive cultures are doing something that’s a bit odd by burning their food or their possessions (maybe even some people). His insight is the idea that these cultures were experiencing a revolutionary realisation: you can forestall gratification now, in the present, and get a payoff in the future. The discovery of sacrifice was mankind’s discovery of the future.
He loves explaining religious concepts using Jungian archetypes, is obsessed with the Soviet Union —you could play a drinking game with the amount of times he mentions Solzhenitsyn’s Gulag Archipelago in his lectures— and passionately fights the waves of meaninglessness that arise from the ashes of this postmodern world.

What I find compelling about him, though, is not really his rich underlying set of ideas. They are interesting in their own way, but have the potential to be fully dismissed as pseudo-intellectual charlatanism. I haven’t decided if this is true yet, but the first interview he had with Sam Harris on the Waking Up Podcast ended up being a two-hour discussion on the nature of truth which, a priori, seemed to expose him as an intellectual fraud. 

No, it is not his set of ideas that’s interesting, but his approach to motivating people to pick themselves up and live a meaningful life. The advice tends to go along these lines: stop saying things that you know to be untrue, have an aim in life, and organise your life around that aim starting from simple accomplishments. Cleaning up your room is the most basic one (he insists so much on this that it has become a meme) because your room is a part of the cosmos you can control even if you’re a complete mess of a human being. 

There is a danger, however, to all his popularity as a pseudo-intellectual YouTube superstar. His hard stance on identity politics and certain ideas of the left has gained him some support from factions of the alt-right. It probably makes no sense to try to categorize him into some part of the political spectrum. If I had, I’d probably call him a classical liberalist. But his notoriety has led to red-pillers, 4chan shitposters and alt-righters to become a slight part of his following, creating a sort of cult-like following that can make the average listener a bit uneasy. And the temptation to pander to these groups will always be there, considering he gets about $30,000 a month on Patreon donations. Let’s just hope he doesn’t fall, and keeps focusing on getting people to attempt to live meaningful lives in the ocean of chaos that is the world we live in.
