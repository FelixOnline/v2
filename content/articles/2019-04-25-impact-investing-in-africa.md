According to The Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN), impact investment can be defined as investment made into companies, organisations, and funds with the intention to generate social and environmental impact alongside a financial return. Hence, impact investing in Africa is the deployment of investment in African companies, organisations, and funds with intentions to generate social, health, and environmental impact alongside a financial return. It is important to note that categorical impact investing in Africa is significantly different from charitable aids given to Africa as the latter does not usually drive investment / financial rewards for the charity giver. Impact investment in Africa attracts a broad range of investors, primarily fund managers, development finance institutions, institutional investors, and foundations. There is a broad range of asset classes which includes: equity, commodity, fixed income, foreign exchange, property, and derivates. Actual numerical quantification and data on the market size of impact investing in Africa remains very limited.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework developed by United Nations serves as a driving force and framework for impact investing in Africa. An Annual Impact Investor Survey report by The GIIN showed that more than half of impact investors are tracking some or all of their performance against SDGs. Furthermore, there is strong appetite for impact investors to catalyse impact investing towards SDGs. However, the United Nations continues to argue the case for more capital and investment deployment to drive and grow impact investing in Africa and on a global scale. The UN estimates that USD 5-7 trillion is needed annually to achieve the goals.

Impact investing has been hailed as a transformational and revolutionary investment methodology for revitalising and growing African economies. However, the vision is increasingly distant from the reality. According to a UNDP study “Impact Investment in Africa: Trends, Constraints and Opportunities”, the 9 key challenges facing impact investment in Africa are:

1. General lack of awareness and understanding of impact investment;
1. Difficulty in sourcing viable investments that meet both financial and social/environmental objectives in Africa;
1. Limited availability of innovative fund and deal structures;
1. Difficulty exiting investments;
1. Poor visibility and inadequate recognition of social enterprise status;
1. Lack of capital supply across the risk/return spectrum;
1. Inadequate policy and regulatory environment;
1. Poor linkages between social enterprise, investors, and innovation networks; and
1. Poor and inconsistent impact measurement practice.

In order to address the highlighted challenges facing impact investment in Africa, the Impact Investment Action Plan was developed as shown in Figure 1. The primary aim of the Impact Investment in Africa Action Plan is to support the development of a vibrant impact investment sector on the African continent. The overarching vision is the development of a vibrant impact investment sector in Africa. The stated vision is further supported with five key intermediate outcomes and a supporting pan-African action plan and action network as in Figure 2.
