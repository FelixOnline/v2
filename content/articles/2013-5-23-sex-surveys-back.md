[The Sex Survey has come back for another fucking year](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/3623/sex-survey-2013/). Well that’s a couple of puns out of the way, so I guess we can get onto more serious(ish) stuff.

We have the pretty infographics for you to look at, as well as plenty of analysis. Hope you enjoy it! Just tap here and go testicles, sorry, nuts.

There are some very interesting things to pick out of the survey. This small X-Rated picture paints quite a few words, and has some surprising, and less surprising, results. For students that remember the previous incarnations: don’t worry, there’s all the stuff you want to see like which Department are the biggest wankers.

Let’s be clear on a few things: this is a bit of a tongue in cheek look into the sex lives of Imperial students. It’s by no means going to be 100% accurate, but it definitely has its merits and there are a lot of interesting things to read. The data analysis has been a long process, involving a lot of organising and a lot of information. Publishing the results had to be delayed to allow us enough time to look through everything. There is no possible way that we can go through everything and 100% analyse the results to perfection: we are, after all, a small student newspaper, and don’t have the resources to go through it all in perfect detail. If you spot something we missed out or messed up, let us know, and we can correct it for next year. We know we’ll probably mess up the wording here are there.

There are also plenty of questions we could have asked. We wanted to limit it to not make it too laborious to fill out and analyse: this was in the hope that people wouldn’t get bored half way through completing it and not bother to finish it off. So sometimes we only touched on a subject briefly. Maybe next year some topics that people found interesting can be explored out in more detail.

There were a lot of responses and not too many trolls, well, not many obvious trolls. This does bring up the serious point: people lie on surveys. They really do. Every single survey ever done in the history of the world will have people lying. Therefore there is always the worry that people are fibbing. Obviously, the best we can really do about this is just ignore them and/or point out odd trends.

The British are known for our slight shyness. It seems it is not a reputation we fully deserve, but the results still spat out some interesting conclusions for us to swallow. One that springs to mind under the pressure of a deadline rumbling towards me is the responses we received for the question about online dating. We all thought a lot of people would say they have tried it, but it didn’t seem so. Whether this is true or people are (sensually) massaging the truth due to embarrassment or some perceived social stigma is up to you – although we quickly investigated it. People did seem fairly willing to try it out though. There were many more interesting observations to be made, but I don’t have the space to talk about them in the three columns I have here.

We took data protection seriously. At no point could we find out who you were. All we looked at when analysing the results was just the replies: it just showed the responses that you gave in an Excel document, it didn’t show who gave what. After the analysis was done, the data was deleted. For more information on this, email[ felix@imperial.ac.uk](mailto: felix@imperial.ac.uk).

A big personal thanks to all of the people that helped with analysis!

Finally, a gigantic thank you to all of the respondents. We couldn’t have done this without you. Well, we could have I guess, but it would just be self stimulation, which, apparently, a lot of you like... So maybe that wouldn’t have been that bad.
