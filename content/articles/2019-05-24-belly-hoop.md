As previously featured, during the summer term ICU Belly Dancing hosts a summer workshop series instead of regular classes, due to the disruption that arises from exams happening at different points in term across departments. All of our workshops are suitable for beginners, so even if you’ve never danced before, you’re more than welcome to join us! The series continues in two weeks’ time on Tuesday (4th June) at 6-8pm with Belly Hoop in Activity Space 1 in the Union Building (£7 otd for non-members). 

Here’s what to expect from our third workshop of term: Belly Hoop. This workshop is a little different to others where we will be learning some belly dance moves and some hooping moves and combining them! We’ll be starting right from the basics so don’t worry if you’ve never belly danced or hula hooped before. 

This will be an exciting class that will help you practise your isolations and gives you a great workout. Rani (our treasurer) and Andrea (the founder of Belly Hoop at Imperial) will be running this exciting Belly Hoop experience. You may remember they ran this workshop last winter at the Dance Imperial workshop weekend and it was a complete hit, so we decided to bring it back!  Rani will be leading you through some basic belly dance moves focusing on technique and style and Andrea will be teaching some basic hooping skills involving some static, dynamic and travelling steps. Together they will then demonstrate how to combine belly dance with hooping. To finish the workshop Andrea will be bringing along her LED hoop if anyone would like to try it out. So, if you’re up for a challenge or want to try something new, come along to the Belly Hoop workshop. 

Unfortunately, there is a limited number of hoops which will be given out on a first come, first served basis so book your place fast if you would like to try this fun and challenging workshop. The final workshop in the series is “vintage combos” tribal fusion workshop on 18th June, keep an eye out for more information on this workshop. Our regular classes will start up again in October, when we will run a weekly beginners’ class for newcomers to the style! You can email bellydancing@ imperial.ac.uk if you would like details on any of our activities.
