__A: You are the cheese grader for Cathedral City. What does Cathedral City Cheese have different from other cheese brands?__

M: All of the cheese used for Cathedral City is made at the award winning Davidstow Creamery on the north Cornish coast. The meadows are lush and the milk is creamy. All these factors combine to deliver a highly consistent product with a wonderful flavour profile.

__A: I’ve read that you often grade 500 cheese samples a day. If I ask you to choose the best cheese product that you have ever tasted, which one would it be?__

M: It is correct that on a busy day I can grade in the region of 500 samples. Davidstow is a large producer by any measure and there are a lot of cheese to be assessed. My two favourite cheeses are Cathedral City Vintage-20 and a nice gooey, cabbage smelling Brie.

__A: What knowledge and skills are needed to be a cheese grader?__

M: First the ability to taste accurately and consistently, secondly a good understanding of the manufacturing process, thirdly focus and concentration, and finally a thick skin if you need to reject product.

__A: Do you enjoy your job? Are there any moments when you simply don’t want to eat any more cheese?__

M: I do enjoy my work and it is one of those jobs that if you didn’t you would soon be found wanting. There are times when I have certainly had enough cheese but never too much and I often eat cheese in the evening even after a full days tasting!

__A: Can you suggest any simple cheese-based recipe to Imperial College students? __

M: There are so many easy ‘twists’ to cheese on toast – cheddar with Stilton sprinkled on top then grilled, mushrooms, tomatoes, something hot and spicy? Use your imagination, I often use it as a way to use up some odds and ends from the fridge. Very cost effective too!

__A: What would you have on your ideal Christmas cheeseboard?__

M: I’d go British all the way – Cathedral City Mature as the broad appeal cheese, M&S Cornish Cruncher for some real character, Cornish Brie for super creamy texture, Red Leicester for the splash of colour and regionality, and a soft goats cheese for a change of taste and texture.

__A: Are there any general tips to enjoy cheese at its best?__

M: Always store cheese in the fridge. When it comes in a re-closeable pack then keep it in that pack, If not ideal tightly wrap in grease proof paper rather than cling film (it can go sweaty) and finally take out of the fridge approx 15 mins before use if not for cooking.

__A: Is Cathedral City currently in the process of producing a new product?__

M: We have just launched the kids snacks ‘Chedds’ which was a big project launch for us. In recent years there has been our Mild, Lighter and Vintage-20 cheeses and, yes, there will be more to come. Consumer trends change and develop so standing still is only an option for the foolish!

__A: Which restaurant or café in London do you recommend for delicious cheese-based dishes? Any favourite dish in particular?__

M: As much as I love a great restaurant meal I really enjoy what I would call ‘great cafe grub’ and on that theme the simple done really well is such a treat. Hot cheesy quiche with a non-soggy base is a simple pleasure.

On the chef front look out for a guy called Nathan Outlaw – fantastic!
