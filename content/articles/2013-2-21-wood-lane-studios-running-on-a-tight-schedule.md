There is fear in the College Council that the contractor, ISG, who have the £39 million construction contract for the accommodation blocks at the new White City campus, may not be hitting their “target completion date”.

According to the [September 2012 meeting minutes](https://workspace.imperial.ac.uk/secretariat/Public/Minutes/Council/Council%20Minutes%2025%20Sept%202012.pdf) the venture was originally to end in September 2013, however an agreement was made to give accommodation to some students early. ISG therefore had a target competition date for the end of August 2013, a date that now looks overly ambitious.
 The College Council deemed the current timings “extremely tight” and have therefore asked that the situation be “closely monitored”.
