Last weekend saw the return of the prestigious Roehampton Club University Cup, with 16 mixed teams across the country playing in a tournament renowned for its high standard of squash.

Since winning the inaugural tournament Imperial had sat on the sidelines as team after team had lifted the glorious Roehampton Cup. The first team from Imperial, made up of Ian Jubb, Jez Carter, James McCouat, Tom Readshaw (captain), and Ann Babtie, had their confidence smashed in the very first match of the tournament when they were drawn against the mighty Leicester in the group stages. Leicester, now taking after their local football team, were a force to be reckoned with as they took the win from Imperial 3-2.

Meanwhile, the second Imperial team, made up of Kharthik Chakravarthy, Sam Horne, Nick Dunn (captain), Ujjval Jaipuria, and Uttara Raju, had their work cut out for them in a tough group containing LSE, Kings and Bristol. They gave the other teams a good run for their money but ultimately came up short. The first team picked themselves up, remembered their training, and went on to batter eternal rivals UCL and Bristol 2nd’s to secure their place in the quarter-finals against Leicester 2nds.

After destroying Leicester’s 2nd team in an attempt to intimidate their 1sts (who were now blazing towards the final from the other half of the draw) Imperial 1sts were set to take on Bristol in the semi-final. Meanwhile, Imperial 2nds managed to beat Kings 2nds 3-2 before finally succumbing to UCL 3-2 to finish in a commendable 14th place. Tensions were high at semi-final time as Imperial and Bristol were drawn at 2-2.

The hopes of playing in the final fell on Ian Jubb to win the deciding match. With almost unnatural composure he secured the win and Imperial’s place in the final against the big dogs, Leicester. Fuelled by revenge (and the club’s excellent Sunday roast dinner), Imperial were ready for the final. With fantastic performances from all of the team, and victories in some extremely tight matches, Imperial overcame unlikely odds to reclaim their place as champions of the Roehampton squash tournament.

The prize giving followed, with a memorable and witty speech from team captain turned comedian Tom Readshaw being a particular highlight. As reward for an outstanding performance each player received a Bohemian crystal trophy, VIP tickets to Canary Wharf squash classic and a year’s squash membership at Roehampton Club, valued at around £500.
