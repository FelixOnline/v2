In 1978 the very first Sundance Film Festival took place, with the goal of showcasing the potential of American independent cinema. On offer were films from the likes of Martin Scorsese and Elia Kazan. It is fair to say that since then Sundance has been an integral part of the independent film revolution. If John Cassavetes was the father that conceived American independent cinema, then Robert Redford’s Sundance Institute was the loving mother that tenderly nurtured it. 

A decade later a 26 year old Steven Soderbergh took his directorial debut to Park City, claiming the Audience Award at the festival, and going on to win the prestigious Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival, as well as earning an Academy Award nomination for Original Screenplay. _Sex, Lies, and Videotape_ would go on to be a huge financial success, signalling the acceptance of young run-and-gun indie filmmakers into both the hearts of the mainstream public and the minds of the upper echelons of world cinema. In the quarter of a century since then the likes of Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, Darren Aronofsky, Kelly Reichardt, Wes Anderson, Ava DuVernay, Damian Chazelle and David O. Russell have all gotten their big break at Sundance, either through the Institute’s many film programs, workshops, and labs, or through premiering their early projects at the festival, underlining Sundance’s prominence in shaping the modern cinematic landscape.

Yet the last couple of editions of the Sundance Film Festival have seen a further evolution, with prestigious films premiering there in the hope of scoring major awards more than a year later. Cases in point include 2014’s _Whiplash_, which went on to score five Oscar nominations, and 2016’s _Manchester by the Sea_, which went on to earn six.

Last year’s stellar line-up continued this trend, with _Get Out_, _The Big Sick_, _Mudbound_, and, in particular, _Call Me by Your Name_ all hoping for nods when the Academy Award nominations are announced next week. The festival has always served as something of a shop window – for those with films playing this is not a traditionally enjoyable time, as their agents and producers desperately seek distribution deals. 2017 saw an all-time high for films being picked up, with the likes of A24, Amazon, and Netflix being serial offenders. As ever, the festival continued to put a diverse range of voices on display: LGBTQ+ films had a strong showing with _Call Me by Your Name_, _God’s Own Country_, and _Beach Rats_; Asian-American life was given the spotlight in _Columbus_ and _Gook_; and female directors Eliza Hittman, Dee Rees, Maggie Betts, and Gillian Robespierre earned some of the best reviews of the fortnight.

Perhaps most notable were the astonishingly small-scale films that meditatively dealt with colossal themes of time and memory in _A Ghost Story_ and _Marjorie Prime_. Twelve months ago we were delivered one of the finest Sundances in history, and a very good year followed, with an extremely diverse Oscar race still yet to play out. Let us now turn our attention to what the 2018 festival has in store.
As usual with Sundance, a host of the films on show are debuts from new faces, and a great part of the fun is discovering budding Andersons, Tarantinos, Soderberghs, and Aronofskys at their earliest stages. It’s difficult to say much about them, but we can certainly speculate on the biggest name at this year’s festival: Gus Van Sant. Van Sant is a gifted auteur, able to deliver awards friendly crowd-pleasers such as _Good Will Hunting_ and _Milk_, but far better known for his quirky indies such as _My Own Private Idaho_ and _Drugstore Cowboy_. Appreciated worldwide, as evidenced by his Palme d’Or win for the haunting _Elephant_, Van Sant has recently been on a poor run of form epitomised by the much-maligned _Sea of Trees_. He enters Sundance with _Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far On Foot_, a dark comedy biopic based on controversial quadriplegic cartoonist John Callahan. The intriguing subject of the film will be portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, reuniting with the man who directed him in his breakthrough performance more than twenty years ago in _To Die For_. Phoenix is joined by a strong cast including Rooney Mara, Jonah Hill, and Jack Black, and the project already has a May release date with Amazon Studios. Here’s to hoping for a return to form for Van Sant.

It is increasingly common for actors, and those in other fields, to make their directorial debut at Sundance. Last year saw Taylor Sheridan complete the border trilogy he wrote, following up Sicario and Hell or High Water by stepping into the director’s chair with Wind River. This year it is the turn of Paul Dano (period drama _Wildlife_), Rupert Everett (Oscar Wilde adaptation _The Happy Prince_), Idris Elba (crime film _Yardie_), comedian Bo Burnham (comedy _Eighth Grade_) and rapper Boots Riley (comedic fantasy sci-fi _Sorry to Bother You_). Though not making their debuts, the relatively inexperienced Ethan Hawke (country music biopic _Blaze_) and cinematographer Reed Morano (sci-fi _I Think We’re Alone Now_), fresh from dominating TV with _The Handmaid’s Tale_, are in the U.S. Dramatic Competition.

Returning to Park City are festival veterans Tamara Jenkins, the Zellner brothers, Debra Granik, Brett Haley, and Desiree Akhavan. It has been 11 years since Jenkins premiered superb comedy _The Savages_ to huge critical acclaim at Sundance. Her latest, _The Private Life_, sounds in a similar vein, with Kathryn Hahn as an author undergoing fertility treatment, placing strain on her relationship with her husband, Paul Giamatti. The Zellners impressed with their last two films, _Kid-Thing_ and _Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter_, at Sundance, and they return with _Damsel_, a comedy-Western sporting an impressive cast including Robert Pattinson, Mia Wasikowska, and Robert Forster. Granik has taken all her films to Sundance. Her last one, _Winter’s Bone_, was nominated for four Academy Awards and gave Jennifer Lawrence a breakthrough role. Little is known about her new feature, _Leave No Trace_, but expect another gritty, hard-hitting drama. Haley is a Sundance regular, and is back again with _Hearts Beat Louder_, a piece about an unlikely father-daughter song-writing duo, featuring Sasha Lane. Lane, who broke out with a starring role in Andrea Arnold’s 2016 Cannes prize-winning road film _American Honey_, is also in Akhavan’s follow-up to the notable debut _Appropriate Behaviour_. Based on the novel by Emily M. Danforth, _The Miseducation of Cameron Post_ is a coming-of-age tale about a girl discovering her own sexuality.
