     The article does not suggest that Selkirk are the only hall that have these rules, it precisely says, "it seems that only Selkirk has had their regulations reinforced, where one student was ‘shocked’ that it was only their halls." <br> <br>In fact, earlier in the article it says, "Sub-warden James Farley-Nicholls said that they were a “re-emphasis of the pre-existing requirements for living in halls.” These requirements were set for all halls at the beginning of term and are simply being re-enforced more rigorously he argues." <br> <br>Your comment to us was as follows: <br> <br>"These rules apply in Tizard as well and always have done. The student are made aware of them on their first day. I believe rules like these are standard across halls and make it a safe environment for everyone." <br> <br>There is nothing in the article that is made up. The article is already clear about the situation, however, I do concede that your comments would have added further clarity.,Some unis have campus-wide noise curfews, and generally

After several recent incidents in Selkirk Halls – mainly involving alcohol – the Wardens have decided to implement a series of rules regarding ‘gatherings’ and noise levels late at night. These regulations request that students inform the wardens about gatherings so that they can be ‘approved’ and have provoked consternation amongst students there. Students have been warned that if gatherings are not reported to Wardens, after repeat offences, they may get fined.

Several students who live in Selkirk (Selkirkians) have been charged with community service and fines from the College Tribunal for the damage caused after recent parties.

The Selkirkians who were given punishments were indignant; they felt that they had no warning as no one had tried coming to talk to them before. Some students feel patronised in regards to the rule about staying quiet after 11pm. One said, “it literally felt as if I was nine years old again.”

However, sub-wardens do not believe that any of the rules introduced are new. Sub-warden James Farley-Nicholls said that they were a “re-emphasis of the pre-existing requirements for living in halls.” These requirements were set for all halls at the beginning of term and are simply being re-enforced more rigorously he argues.

However, many Selkirkians remain disgruntled if not confused by these regulations. Many students are puzzled by the idea of having to report “gatherings” to their wardens, mainly because they have no idea what a gathering is. Even though the wardens have approved time spent in the kitchen, none of the residents are sure as to when they would notify the wardens. Most students stated simply that “they wouldn’t think twice” about sending an email, as gatherings aren’t planned: “They just happen”, commented one resident. However, it seems that wardens are more concerned about large parties, mainly involving alcohol,that would leave a large mess in the kitchens and that the rules were only set due to complaints from residents and cleaners. They only wished to be informed so that they can ensure that any messes are tidied up after and that excessive noise will be controlled.

Some Selkirk residents that are not usually involved in such parties and incidents did feel that these new regulations did not affect them as the rules were “only directed at certain people”. But some do believe that the rules have created a “culture of fear, that a warden will walk in any time” making it harder to just hang out in halls.

One of the most important questions has to be: why only Selkirk? It seems that only Selkirk has had their regulations reinforced, where one student was ‘shocked’ that it was only their halls.

But then again, it seems that only Selkirk have people throwing up in their common room, people breaking restrictors on windows and wandering on fifth floor balconies, spilling oil on the fourth floor and inviting people who aren’t from their halls, because no other hall does that, right?

To keep the peace, it seems that Selkirkans should be more considerate of other residents around them, whilst the Sub-wardens should be more lenient on “gatherings” within the halls. On a positive note, the Sub-wardens have promised,“if things improve then the requirements will be relaxed.” But for now, it seems its ‘bed time, lights out’ for Selkirk.
