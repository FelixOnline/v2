 - I can understand the logic behind moving away from the formal dinner subsidy for few takes away from enjoyment of all but I think its a massive shame Especially as college is too fucking stingy to provide one on Graduation day its the only opportunity lots of people get to have one with their friends when they graduate This is bound to be unpopular which is perhaps why the decision was made quietly and with no discussion with the student bodyI can see that some will not like the formal affair but myself and many others feel that having one night a year where you can get dressed up and celebrate the end of the year with drinks and friends is greatAs a final year who was looking forward to getting the full works this time havent had the dinner before as it is so expensive Im am doubly disappointed We are now forced to organise our own dinner and will probably have it on the evening of the ball in order to avoid the no doubt tedious acts headlinedUnfortunate that the BioBiomed stude

End of year summer exams, nobody likes them. It is the best way to ruin the best season of the year and everyone dreads them. But now there's something epic to look forward to, because this year, not only is there an end of year summer ball, but there's a whole day of live performances to go with it.

Basically, the Union is planning a festival, with events scattered across the Imperial campus. Plans are underway for various activities to take place during the day, giving the Summer Ball a more 'festival-esque' feel.

The Union are going all out this year â€“ not only are they adding in the all-day festival but they will have live music (including more student acts) on a large stage in Queen's Lawn and a smaller stage in Princes Gardens. In addition to this there will be upmarket food and various other stalls.

The Union says that they're moving away from the standard formal dinner approach and are trying something different this year. The possibility of collaborating with other London universities is also being considered, to make the event bigger and better than ever (and to have a wider range of acts).

Taking you back to your primary school summers, there are plans for more 'fun-fair'-like activities to take place on the day of the ball and the Union aim for the festival to end with "enough time to finish your drinks and catch the tube home if you want" according to Deputy President (Finances & Services) [Ravi Pall](http://felixonline.co.uk/?article=763), with the after-party continuing after in FiveSixEight and Metric, as well as the Great Hall.

So when is this ultra-spectacular and unmissable event? The date for your diaries folks is the 18th of June (conveniently chosen as a date close to the end of exams so that all students can attend). It'll undeniably be a great way to celebrate the end of another great year at Imperial.
