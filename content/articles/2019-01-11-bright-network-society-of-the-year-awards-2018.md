Imperialâ€™s Energy Journal Team were amongst teams from universities across the country to be nominated for the Bright Network Society of the Year Awards.

The Energy Journal was shortlisted in the Innovation category due to their unique concept for a cross-university collaboration, their use of technology for publication and advertising, and their ambitious plans for future growth. Other award categories included Diversity and Representation, Impact on Campus and Community Outreach. Societies from across the UK were invited to the awards ceremony, held in the Rumpus Room on the South Bank.

The Energy Journal is a biannual publication about current affairs in the energy industry, built by a collaborative cross-university team from Imperial College, London School of Economics and University College London.
