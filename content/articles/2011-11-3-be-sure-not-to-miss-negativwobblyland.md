San Francisco cut/paste sound collage pioneers NegativLand team up with fellow Fog City resident Wobbly for an evening of home made electronics. The collaboration is centred around the exploitation of The Booper, a fully analogue device put together from salvaged radio and amplifier parts, creating an unpredictable beast whose temperament is as mysterious as the racket it generates.

Support comes from prolific Argentinian noiser Alan Courtis and Evol’s “computer music for hooligans.”
