It has emerged that the decision to [cut Imperial’s £3,000 per year membership](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/1291/imperial-cuts-ties-with-case/) of the Campaign for Science and Engineering (CaSE) was made by the College’s [Management Board](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/secretariat/governance/committees/managementboard).

A trusted source, who wished to remain anonymous, told Felix that the Board felt that Imperial could lobby effectively by itself and through the Russell Group, and therefore had a reduced need for [CaSE](http://sciencecampaign.org.uk/).

A College spokesperson did not confirm or deny the claim but did appear to suggest that Imperial’s own lobbying efforts were sufficient, saying that “every week many members of the College are interacting at the most senior levels in government and Parliament” to ensure that Imperial’s interests are properly represented.

The spokesperson also said that Imperial had made savings in excess of £70,000 over the past two years due to ceased subscriptions. He further explained the principles behind the decision, saying that the College looks for “clear benefits from the membership or subscription fees it pays,” which in general involves influence on the organisation’s strategy or the receipt of direct services that benefit Imperial’s activities.

CaSE Director [Imran Khan](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/1347/an-eloquent-spokesperson-for-science/) said “senior government ministers have publicly credited” his organisation with “helping to make the argument for sustained investment in science, and for making sure that the UK’s immigration rules reward science and engineering skills.” He said that most CaSE members saw this as a benefit of support CaSE but said he respected Imperial’s right to take a different view.
