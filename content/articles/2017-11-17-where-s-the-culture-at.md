**GREEN PARK**

_Royal Academy_: Best known for its annual extravaganza - the Summer Exhibition - the RA hosts a whole range of exhibitions. Upcoming shows not to be missed are _Jasper Johns; ‘Something Re-sembling Truth’_, and _Dali/Duchamp_, an exhibition that will  explore how their outlook on art and life intersected.

**SOUTH KENSINGTON**

_V&A_: A world leader for all things decorative arts and design.  Admission is free, but for some of the more in-depth exhibitions, you’ll have to pay – like for the _Pink Floyd: Their Mortal Remains_ exhibit, which we highly recommend. It also has some great cafes if you’re looking for somewhere to study off-campus.

**SLOANE SQUARE**

_Royal Court Theatre_: Prides itself on being the ‘writer’s theatre’ showcasing some of the best scripts from upcoming and established play-wrights. Two of its plays – _Cyprus Avenue_, and _The Children_ – featured in Guardian Theatre Critic Michael Billington’s top 10 list for 2016, and its production of the _Ferryman_ earlier this year was so popular it has been revived for an extended run in the West End.

**PIMLICO**

_Tate Britain_: Home to fantastic art and is another gallery that regularly throws its doors open late into the evening. Uniqlo Tate Lates take place on the last Friday of each month; go to enjoy live music, talks, and interactive workshops as well food and drink. 

**PICCADILLY CIRCUS**

_National Portrait Gallery_: The cosier neigh-bour to the National Gallery, the NPG focuses just on portraits. The _BP National Portrait Awards_ is being exhibited right now, brilliant for looking at the work of lesser known artists. Each Friday the gallery is open until 9 pm, a cocktail bar pops up, there’s live music, and a free drawing session (all materials provided) all as part of the Late Shift.

_National Gallery_: Right in the middle of London’s tourist heartland, the National Gallery houses everything fantastically alien-looking babies painted in the Middle Ages to the work of the Impressionists and Cubists, all for free. There are frequent excellent special exhibitions too; look out for  Van Eyck and Pre Raphaelites, opening next week. The gift shop is great for arty posters (complete with handy student discounts) to liven up your new rooms.

**COVENT GARDEN**

_Royal Opera House_: The main venue for opera performances in London, the historical ROH runs an extensive programme of operas, ballets and contemporary genres ranging from classical productions to more experimental interpretations.

_Donmar Warehouse_: Located in Covent Garden, the Donmar Warehouse is home to exciting new writing, contemporary reappraisals of European classics and small-scale drama and musical theatre.

**WATERLOO**

_The Old Vic_: Located in Waterloo – 10 minutes from Xenia Hall if you’re living that far out – the Old Vic puts on some of the most impressive pro-ductions in the capital outside the West End, for those of all ages.

**SOUTHWARK**

_The Young Vic_: Also in Waterloo, the Young Vic Theatre was established in 1970 and showcases some fantastic theatre for fantastically low prices. The theatre claims to have the most ‘diverse and engaged audience in London’ and features a main auditorium with a seating plan that changes from production to production.

**EMBANKMENT**

_National Theatre_: Reliably excellent, the NT is home to three theatres; the Olivier, Lyttleton and Dorfman. The roster is varied, from political dramas to blockbuster musicals, so there’s something for everybody.

**BLACKFRIARS**

_Tate Modern_: On the river at the South Bank, the Tate Modern is one of the most exciting venues in the capital for modern art. _Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age Black Power_, an exhibi-tion exploring the rich and varied legacy of the African American artists working during the Civil Rights Era is on at the moment.

**LEICESTER SQUARE**

_English National Opera_: The ENO is the second-largest opera company in London, but with all its performances sung in English. A good introduction to the world of opera, the ENO has a calendar of classical pieces and contemporary works.

**BARBICAN**

_The Barbican_: With an auditorium housing the London Symphony and the BBC Symphony Orchestras, a theatre housing the Royal Shakespeare Company, as well as a gallery, cinema, and library, the Barbican is largest performing arts centre in Europe. Basically, it’s arts Mecca. It’s ‘What’s On’ section is jammed packed year-round so anything and everything you could hope to see is here. On top of that, it’s housed in a Grade II listed building which itself is worth a visit.

**ALDGATE EAST**

_Whitechapel Gallery_: Near Brick Lane where all the top curry houses in London are, the Whitechapel gallery is the one of the most interesting venues in the capital, a longtime champion of all types of con-temporary art, particularly film.  The Whitechapel often has its finger on the pulse of what’s about to make it big in the world of art.
