The title says it all really! Merry Christmas and have a fantastic new year everybody. If you have exams, then, as I said before: relax, panic a bit, but try to take at very least Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve off. Saying that, I’m pretty sure that for my third and fourth year exams I didn’t take New Year’s Eve off. Not to rub it in your faces, but this is the first exam free holiday I’ve had in years and I’m frankly absolutely loving it.

I also want to use this opportunity and space to openly invite every single person to write for Felix! Honestly, I don’t bite, unless you’re into that sort of thing. It really is a great break from your work and can be lots of fun. Plus, groan, it may even look alright on your CV.

There are some other issues to address though. The [Holland Club](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/2931/holland-club-closed/) will soon be closing its doors. Maybe it’ll pop up somewhere else at some point, but it will be interesting to see what happens with that space.

[Podcasting](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/3027/podcasting-arrives-well-sort-of/), well, it’s a reality in a way. It was a big thing a while ago and they are crawling their way out. By that I mean that they are being rolled out at a pace that a snail would scorn for being “a bit slow”. The big question really is: if others can do it, why can’t we? Yeah, obviously you shouldn’t just do something as others do, but that’s not the point here.

This is an issue I find interesting as I think it would have been pretty useful. There was one lecturer who did podcasts in my time, but that was it from what I remember. I don’t understand what’s so tough about recording something and shoving it on the internet. Obviously, that’s not the hard part. The tough bit is the boring stuff about people not wanting to be seen lecturing in public. This raises the inevitable: if you’ve got nothing to hide, then what’s the problem question. That issue is actually just one of many with lecture videos/audio, but, as it’s Christmas, and unless you want smaller pretty pictures (which you don’t) I will leave it at that and let you mull over the idea of podcasts yourself. They were brought up, specifically and unprompted, in feedback questionnaires. However, think about this: do you want them if you don’t have them? Do you use them at all if you do? It would be really interesting to see how much of the student body thinks it would be a great addition to learning resources.
