Changes to the league that Imperial College London’s sports teams play in could require some reorganisation.

The teams are currently split into Imperial College (which is all of the subjects from the university) and Medics (which, as hinted in the name, is Medicine).

However, it was brought up in Council on Monday 8 October by the President of the Imperial College School of Medicine Students’ Union President, Shiv Vorha, that the league is going to force Imperial to change. This change could mean that teams will lose positions in leagues, or be put into different leagues. It was decided at Council that it would be more pertinent for the sports teams to discuss the issue.
