Daenerys Targaryon (Game of Thrones)

Stick on a blonde wig and smudge dirt on your face. Don’t worry if you don’t have dragons to complete the costume; it’ll add to the authenticity when you knock on your neighbours’ door screaming, “Where are my dragons??”

Tobias Fünke (Arrested Development)

Who better to go as than the world’s first ‘Analrapist’? All you need is blue paint and a fake ‘tache. Just don’t forget the denim cut-offs or you get might get a bit chilly (and scare any children).

Ruby Tandoh(Great British Bake Off)

Just add an over-sized cardie, denim jacket, and an air of self-deprecating anxiety. If anyone compliments you on your costume, shrug your shoulders and tell them you thought it’d come out a bit shit, to be honest.

Anyone from Made in Chelsea

Pull on your finest red Jack Wills trousers, get yourself a goatee, slap on the fake tan, and you’re good to go. Now go back upstairs and get changed; even Halloween isn’t worth looking like that much of a tosser.

Walter White (Breaking Bad)

You’ll never look as good as this baby, but that’s not to stop you from trying. Everyone’s favourite meth dealer is easy enough to impersonate: key components are a bad ass hat and menacing stare (the meth is optional).
