__Daenerys Targaryon (Game of Thrones)__

Stick on a blonde wig and smudge dirt on your face. Don’t worry if you don’t have dragons to complete the costume; it’ll add to the authenticity when you knock on your neighbours’ door screaming, “Where are my dragons??”

__Tobias Fünke (Arrested Development)__

Who better to go as than the world’s first ‘Analrapist’? All you need is blue paint and a fake ‘tache. Just don’t forget the denim cut-offs or you get might get a bit chilly (and scare any children).

__Ruby Tandoh(Great British Bake Off)__

Just add an over-sized cardie, denim jacket, and an air of self-deprecating anxiety. If anyone compliments you on your costume, shrug your shoulders and tell them you thought it’d come out a bit shit, to be honest.

__Anyone from Made in Chelsea__

Pull on your finest red Jack Wills trousers, get yourself a goatee, slap on the fake tan, and you’re good to go. Now go back upstairs and get changed; even Halloween isn’t worth looking like that much of a tosser.

__Walter White (Breaking Bad)__

You’ll never look as good as this baby, but that’s not to stop you from trying. Everyone’s favourite meth dealer is easy enough to impersonate: key components are a bad ass hat and menacing stare (the meth is optional).
