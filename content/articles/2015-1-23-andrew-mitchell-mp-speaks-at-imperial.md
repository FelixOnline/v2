Former cabinet minister and current MP for Sutton Coldfield, Andrew Mitchell spoke to students this week about the importance of aid and charity in improving the lives of people in the developing world.

In front of large audience in Blackett Lecture Theatre 1, Mitchell – perhaps best known to readers for his involvement in the so-called “plebgate” scandal – spoke about his two years as International Development Secretary.

Tuesday’s event, organised by Imperial Raising and Giving (RAG), covered a wide range of topics, from the importance of educating women in overcoming the hardships faced by those communities living in extreme poverty.

What Britain excels at, Mitchell said, is using development funding to generate lasting social and political solutions: training teachers and doctors, not just building schools and hospitals. Mitchell was also keen to emphasise the benefits that foreign aid spending can bring to the UK: helping British business and reducing the risk of conflict and terrorism.

Turning to his record in government, Mitchell said he is proud of pushing through the Bribery act that prevents companies engaging in corrupt practices abroad that they would never consider doing in the UK.

He was also keen to stress the decisions made at DfID to ensure efficiencies and value for money for the taxpayer, often, for instance, paying charities and NGOs to carry out operations, rather than using an already overstretched military.

Mitchell also defended the UK’s historic aid to India. Although this funding is now being wound down, the government has been criticised for still providing aid to a country, which now has its own space programme.

In response, he pointed out the levels of poverty that still exist there, and that the space programme is privately funded, and will aid India’s development through improved communications across the vast country.

Mitchell was also keen to encourage students to get involved in international development, and offered advice to those considering a career in the sector.

When asked how he would respond to those critical of funding projects overseas in a time of difficulties in the UK, he replied: “charity begins at home, but it doesn’t end there.”

Mr Mitchell has had a varied career including spells as an army officer and an investment banker before first entering parliament in 1987, before eventually rising to the position of Conservative chief whip.

RAG chair Ben Fernando said: ”I'm really glad Mr Mitchell could come along and engage in a really interesting discussion with us about International Development.

It was also good to see how many passionate people there are at Imperial on this subject.”
