Chelsea v Man City
 (Sunday 4pm, Sky Sports 1)

Chelsea may have beaten Cardiff comfortably on Saturday but still look far from the finished article. Jose Mourinho still doesn’t know his best team, but will be encouraged by how his summer signings are performing. City haven’t improved away from home since the arrival of Manuel Pellegrini and are badly missing Vincent Kompany at the back. They have to push for a win in games like this and I wonder if that might just play into Chelsea’s hands. The Blues are traditionally strong at home and know how to win big matches.
__Prediction: 2-1__

Sunderland v Newcastle
 (Sunday 1:30pm, Sky Sports 1)

Gus Poyet learnt last weekend the sheer magnitude of the task he faces. He has to stop the rot fast, but will need to summon up some team spirit because the quality isn’t there. Newcastle, meanwhile, seem to have clicked since that shocking first half at Everton last month. They provide the bigger goal threat and will therefore be favourites.
__Prediction: 1-2__

Crystal Palace v Arsenal
 (Saturday 12:45pm, BT Sport 1)

Palace look down and out and only some Ian Holloway magic can save their season for me. Arsenal are on a real roll, are outstanding away and should win comfortably. Expect Mezut Ozil and Aaron Ramsey to be on the scoresheet again.
__Prediction: 0-3__

Best of the rest
 (Saturday 3pm unless stated)

Aston Villa v Everton

Paul Lambert has won more points away than at home and Villa do struggle when teams sit back and they cannot counter. Everton won’t sit back though and with Lukaku firing this should be an entertaining contest.
__Prediction: 2-2__

Liverpool v West Brom

The Sturridge-Suarez partnership looks excellent but couldn’t see off Newcastle last time out. The Baggies enjoyed their last visit to the North-West, beating Manchester United, and have the attacking potency to cause Liverpool problems too.
__Prediction: 1-1__

Man United v Stoke

 United dropped points again last weekend and serious questions are now being asked of David Moyes. But Stoke, having gone off the boil after a fine start and don’t have the strikers to inflict another Old Trafford upset.
__Prediction: 2-0__

Norwich v Cardiff

The Canaries are in a false position but face an easier run of games starting this weekend. Sadly for Cardiff fans, the new owner’s needless tinkering looks to have undermined some promising early-season form.
__Prediction: 1-0__

Southampton v Fulham

The Saints are on a remarkable run and there’s no reason they can’t keep going here against a Fulham side whose attackers simply aren’t delivering just now. This could be curtains for Martin Jol.
__Prediction: 2-0__

Swansea v West Ham
 (Sunday 4pm)

West Ham pulled off some result in their last away game, beating Tottenham 3-0, but folded against Manchester City. Thumping Sunderland, however, might just have kick-started Swansea’s season.
__Prediction: 1-0__

Tottenham v Hull
 (Sunday 4pm)

Hull are the season’s surprise package but defeats at Chelsea, Manchester City and Everton suggest they can’t yet challenge top teams. Spurs should win here.
__Prediction: 1-0__
