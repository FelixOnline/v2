Remember the good old days, when we had the environment themed shows like Captain Planet? Well, if you miss that era, here are some shows that’ll help you get your fill of green TV.
## Zoo
Zoo is a bizarre little beast that works wonderfully as a TV show precisely because all of its individual elements do not. Based on, of all things, a James Paterson novel, this series chronicles a world thrown increasingly into turmoil as animals everywhere rebel and begin some sort of coordinated attack on humanity. In the midst of this, a ragtag bunch of scientists, reporters, and safari rangers band together in an attempt to sort it all out. Everything about Zoo tries desperately to take itself seriously despite itself. What results is an absurdist’s wet dream.
## Planet Earth II
The sequel to one of the most critically acclaimed nature documentaries of all time, this latest David Attenborough offering was 10 years in the making. This series excelled at highlighting the drama and tension in the seemingly mundane, with the first episode’s lizard sequence rapidly achieving memetic status. Sampling stunning natural beauty from around the world on an unprecedented scale, the series is a must watch for any aficionados of the natural world.
Produced by Bob Saget of all people, this comedy show chronicles the lives of various animals that inhabit New York City. Featuring a rotating cast of comedians, episodes are largely improvised, with participants only being given an overview beforehand. Animals does not squander its premise, instead taking full advantage of the unique opportunities offered by the individual animals’ characteristics. The HBO production credit draws in top comedians, and the show offers some excellent surreal humour.
## Spy in the Wild
A slightly unique spin on the classic nature documentary, Spy in the Wild hinges around a series of animatronic spy cameras. These faux-animals are used to infiltrate herds, and, in-theory, give a never before seen insight into the animals’ group dynamics. The series recently made headlines for a sequence where monkeys are apparently so convinced of a camera’s authenticity, they have a funeral for it when it breaks down. Plus, it’s narrated by David Tennant; who could ever tire of that voice?
