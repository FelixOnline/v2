Ok so this [unsigned instrumental hip-hop producer from California](http://www.myspace.com/beatsbybahwee) isn't necessarily my favourite musician of all time. I'm not really sure that I could choose just one artist anyway. However, he is my favourite musician as of 10:27 this morning when former Science Editor [Katya-yani Vyas](http://felixonline.co.uk/user/kv07/) recommended that I listen to his sick album [Flavors](http://open.spotify.com/album/6pUluYZmRXt8eMBflruEMz).
