 - Mr A GeekAs much as I enjoy editing and reading your articles Im going to have to offer a slight objection this week The reason that I was and often am outspoken about religion is because I believe religion to be extremely divisive I believe much of religions teachings to be wholly immoral and responsible for many atrocities that happen in the world every day or much less in our society I believe that only by discrediting religion at every attempt possible will we eventually rid it and the evils that it breeds from our society I think by not speaking out against it we automatically grant it credibility and in a society in which religion is seen as credible I think extremism is much more likely I would be a lot happier if all religions got together and agreed to take all the nonsense and immorality out of their holy books Until that day however I think its important to speak out against itGreat article as always by the wayDude chill For which of ICs religious societies

I’ve started eating porridge. I waited and waited for the weather to get colder, but at some point it becomes obvious that I’m going to lose the staring contest with BBC Weather and I just break out the oats and jam. All year, I’m just waiting for winter to come around. So now I’m eating porridge every morning, I’ve committed to that for the next few months.

Now, I want you to feel at ease with your choice of breakfast treat. Despite the fact that I’m fairly certain there is no finer way to kick off a miserable day of trudging through South Kensington than a warm bowl of gloopy oats, I don’t want to preach about it. You want to continue eating Shreddies? That is absolutely fine with me. Similarly, I don’t feel like I’m missing out. Yes, there are other cereals available. More pressingly, there are those that opt not to have cereals at all. But that’s alright, because I’ve made a choice for personal reasons, and it’s the right one for me. I’m Angry Geek, and I start my November mornings with porridge.

If we were to, say, replace porridge with ‘atheism’ (bear with me here) and cereals with religion (I have no idea what muffins/crumpets represent here, you can continue the analogy as you wish) we have an entirely different discussion. I have decided not to believe in any god or gods, and I’m comfortable with that decision. Admittedly, there are some mornings when my spiritual porridge has too little milk in and it goes all stodgy, but I manage to push on and stay true to my decision without trying to justify it to every motherfucker who braves the cereal aisle in Sainsbury’s.

Others seem less capable of doing this. I found myself last week in an extraordinarily overlong conversation with several staunch atheists about whether or not it made sense to choose one religion over any other. They delighted in laughing at Christians in general for this reason (“Why not Judaism? Why not Islam?”), and when I suggested that perhaps many people felt modern-day religions all expressed the same basic truths, this was entirely unacceptable. Why? Fuck knows. Everyone involved in the conversation had porridge for breakfast... I mean, was an atheist. Whatever. Maybe both – I never enquired as to their morning preferences.

We were all atheists, yet for some reason we had to debate this meaningless detail of an alternative lifestyle, as if the mere existence of Christians in our immediate vicinity represented some kind of flaw in our own reasoning. Why is Crunchy Nut still on the shelves if porridge is so obviously right? What is the purpose of marmite in this period of rolled oats and preserved fruit? For some reason these weren’t just idle topics of discussion, but fierce points of contention.

It was a couple of weeks ago in Felix that Sam Horti mulled over the question of an afterlife. Surely in hell we would feel no pain, he mused. How would we experience pleasure in heaven without nerve endings and a hypothalmus? Ho ho ho.

The only answer I can offer is that I don’t know. I don’t know how much milk you should put on your Weetabix to avoid complete loss of structural integrity. Maybe hell is, as I’m often told by religious friends, an expression of being absent from God. An infinite stretch of time where you are devoid of the hope of a saviour. Maybe you just put the milk on in little bursts and wait for it to be soaked up before adding more.

I don’t know. But it means nothing to me anyway, because I am having porridge for breakfast tomorrow, and will continue to do so. If people start trying to pour cornflakes into my bowl, I might be urged into action. But in the meantime I think, as porridge eaters, we promote our preference for warm, tasty breakfasts in a far more responsible and reasonable way by allowing other cereal choices to coexist alongside our own.
