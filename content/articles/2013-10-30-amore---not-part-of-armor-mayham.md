Armor Mayhem is a Halo and Unreal Tournament inspired game set in the future when our planet Earth has run out of energy. Major corporations send teams to scavenge the universe in search for more energy. Eventually, energy is detected on planet 55001 and to their astonishment they find infinite energy crystals. Now you must fight for the planet’s resources. Get your weapons and armour on and fight for your CEO to make billions!
 You use the [WASD] keys to direct your player through various landscapes, clicking on your mouse to fire against competition. The controls are simple and seamless.
 Aside from your standard machine gun, various other weapons can be picked up around the landscapes. Health packets also drop from the sky too! As you complete missions and earn money you can unlock more crazy weapons including the ‘slow gun’ which gives you a shot at creating a time-altering zone to slow down your enemies and kill’em. And the Halo inspired dart gun that fires multiple homing darts that stick to the target and explode. Completing missions also unlocks new maps with the difficulty of the missions’ increasing into the game.
 When you, your buddies and your opponents health bar reaches zero they are automatically transported to a random place on the map after 5 seconds.
 Hitting enemies increases your adrenaline meter which can be used [space button] to slow down time in your perspective enabling better stamina and agility in real time. In practise, you tend not to really use it but it’s a fun plus for the gameplay.
 Missions range from single-player, team Deathmatch, capture the flag, territory control to ‘steal the orb’. The missions don’t really adumbrate any storyline which is a bit of a shame however the gameplay really makes up for it. An extra challenge is added for the most skilled gamers in completing a level in a time limit to achieve a gold medal giving you extra purchasing power for weapons and armour. Unfortunately, purchasing more expensive armour does nothing to your stats - the armour is just for design which I thought was a bit cheeky considering some of the price of the armour.
 Another thing – the guns were small and it can be eyestrain sometimes. They have tried to compensate the field of view of the map with the size of the characters however I’m not convinced they’ve captured the golden balance. Some weapons are a lot better than others so the weapon size can really be frustrating.
 Gamers will really love the epic music in this game which pumps you up to achieve crazy killing streaks against your enemy AIs. One song to really look out for is Maze – the Nightkilla and you can change the music whenever you are playing to your liking with six songs in total.
 Custom battles can be unlocked by completing levels in the campaign mode and the difficulty of the levels can be adjusted to the player’s desires. You also have the ability to give players in your team AI commands to follow you though this almost always did not help with the mission or better the game play. To have the ability to order your AI team is quite awesome though.
 Armor mayhem is a must for all shooter games fans and as much fun it is to play against other AIs this game will hugely benefit from an online multiplayer addition where gamers can really appreciate the engine’s depth and appealing platform elements.
