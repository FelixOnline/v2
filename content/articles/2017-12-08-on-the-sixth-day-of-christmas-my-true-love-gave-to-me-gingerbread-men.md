You will need...

- 400g plain flour
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 2 tsp ground ginger
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 125g butter (unsalted)
- 200g honey
- 2 eggs

1. Mix all the dry ingredients and then add in the butter. This step would be really easy if you have a food processor, but I imagine that, as a student, you don’t have such fancy kitchen appliances. You can solve this problem by using a hand mixer in the beginning, but then you have to start with the butter and then gradually add a bit of flour at a time. When your hand mixer cannot do the job anymore, you’ll have to use your hands. Or, of course, you can start from the beginning by using your hands. I have faith in you, you can do this!
1. Beat the egg and the honey together until they are homogeneous. Pour them over the dry ingredients, a little at a time. You should try to avoid lumps in your dough. 
1. Knead the dough until smooth and then wrap in cling-film.
1. Leave to chill in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour.
1. Roll the dough (after you took it out of the fridge and unwrapped it, but if you really need this advice, you should stay out of the kitchen – just saying!) on a floured surface. Cut out the ginger men – or women! Maybe you want to let your inner artist surface, and be creative with the cutting.
1. Bake for 12-20 minutes until golden-brown – to any extent, it shouldn’t take longer than a Two and a Half Men episode. If, meanwhile, your fire alarm starts, you should have taken them out 10 minutes ago, at least!
1. When cool enough (of course they cannot be as cool as you are, but they will try their best), decorate!
1. Optional step: hide them from your hungry flatmates who will finish all your food.
