__Richard Allen II__

Sing-songwriter

Resolutely delivered chords resound through the body of the listener and entice them through Richard Allan’s songs. He explores fundamental ideas and emotions and presents them, bare, to the listener. The frequent poise of the melodies on the break of his voice, which he tightrope walks with captivating purity, reinforces the raw emotion, and the gritty insistence implies frustration. But the tracks are not doom and gloom. Instead the lyrics evoke the feeling of contemplative resolution and this, I think, is what makes Richard’s music clever. Richard has been singing and song-writing for years and it shows. He is at one with his guitar and his newly formed band is already well-integrated, contributing beautifully understated vocal harmonies, drum beats and bass lines. The rhythm and meandering tempo of Richard’s song “Show Me The Way” feels comfortably familiar and this song, in particular, will resonate. And it is a pleasure to become familiar with the songs. Influences such as Patrick Watson and Jack Steadman (Bombay Bicycle Club) are hinted at by fragile vocals, and the Fleet Foxes by lilting but muscular melodies, particularly found in “Stranger”. Richard could benefit from more musical experimentation and variation both within and between songs. However, with his thirst for musical inspiration and continued gigging to audiences in Cambridge, Brighton and London, he is sure to push these boundaries and to inspire his audience. I strongly recommend a YouTube or SoundCloud search for the songs released so far and there will be an EP to listen to in the spring. He is playing at St Pancras Old Church on the 4th of April.![richie photo.jpg](/inc/timthumb.php?src=/img/upload/201303072154-txl11-richie-photo.jpg&w=460px&zc=1&a=t)

__Apples & Eve__

Alternative Folk

There is a beautiful primordial feel to Apples & Eve’s music, accentuated by gig artwork presenting naked drawings of the first woman in the Bible. One can draw parallels between the feminist power of the biblical figure and Eva Howells, the lead singer and sole songwriter in the band. Her striking poise and deep, rich and passionate voice engulfs the listener and keeps you listening for hours. She plays the guitar and the accordion and has acquired a drummer, a violinist, a bassist (who has also worked with the likes of Laura Marling, and James Morrison) and another guitarist along the way, as well as many avid supporters. Eva leads the band, headstrong, though mysterious songs telling of Greek mythology and sea creatures. The texture of the music is like that of treacle and the seductive, lilting rhythms are somewhat reminiscent of walking on a large ship or after one too many glasses of wine. Despite the primitive feel, the songs are musically complex, with lyrical violin solos cutting through the rippling blanket of harmonies and many almost a cappella moments with which Eva lullabies us into contemplation. Influences have been plucked from many an apple tree across blues, gypsy and even reggae. An EP and a single have been released and are well worth a listen. The EP was hand printed using a wood cut on recycled wallets.![AE photo.jpg](/inc/timthumb.php?src=/img/upload/201303072205-txl11-ae-photo.jpg&w=460px&zc=1&a=t)

__Sivu__

Progressive Pop

Courtesy of St Barts Hospital, Sivu recently spent two hours in an MRI scanner recording the video for his first single “Better Man Than He”. Fascination with both the song and the movement of his tongue as he sings has caused Youtube views to rocket. And the Sivu storm has continued to rage following the release of the single. It was recorded with Alt-J producer, Charlie Andrews, and similarities to the hit band are audible, particularly in the layering and the vocal percussion in the track. The orchestration in Sivu’s music, now involving various combinations of voice, cello, violin, keys, drums, harp and omnichord, creates an ambience that lingers long after final notes. Ingenious use of instruments gives each its own stage. Reiterated treble phrases are placed perfectly over rolling waves of reverberating chords, reminiscent of Wild Beasts, and the melodies are ear-worms that stay with you for days. The sound is strangely comforting and dreamy, no matter what you were doing before listening. James Page, the mastermind behind the venture, writes bittersweet lyrics, often both empowering and regretful, and his distinctive voice is perfectly suited to these. He touches on religion, human nature and mental wellbeing, but they are merely suggested and so his songs are neither depressing nor pretentious. His voice is well-enunciated and sticks on certain words, but floats ethereally over others. Sivu’s music can be found on SoundCloud or Youtube, “Better Man Than He” can be purchased on Itunes or Spotify, and there will be an EP out later this year. Definitely one to watch.![Sivu photo.jpg](/inc/timthumb.php?src=/img/upload/201303072159-txl11-sivu-photo.jpg&w=460px&zc=1&a=t)

__The Intermission Project__

Funk/Soul

Currently London’s favourite band of 18-year-olds, The Intermission Project was formed when two school friends embarked on a gap year of music-making whilst they decide what road to take in life. Six months in, they’ve paved this road already. On the way they have adopted Sam, an alternating saxophonist/cellist whose smile they spotted at a gig, and the resulting composition of the band is delightful. Jim Rubaduka, the lead singer, has an effortlessly rich and characterful voice, perfectly tuned over every twist and turn. Alex Watson tracks the melody with tight vocal harmonies & reinforces the bright sound on the banjo and mandolin. The sound is relatively simple but the melodies ingeniously memorable. Despite their young age and the band’s infancy, emotions in their songs successfully span joy, regret and hope, bringing a charming youthfulness but also a remarkable maturity wherever appropriate. And the band blends genres – the layered string instruments and vocal harmonies suggest folk whilst the fluid saxophone solos and warmth in Jim’s voice brings a welcome dose of soul. The Intermission Project have music on YouTube and SoundCloud and are recording an EP at the moment. Their grinning enthusiasm is a joy to watch.![TIP photo.jpg](/inc/timthumb.php?src=/img/upload/201303072202-txl11-tip-photo.jpg&w=460px&zc=1&a=t)
