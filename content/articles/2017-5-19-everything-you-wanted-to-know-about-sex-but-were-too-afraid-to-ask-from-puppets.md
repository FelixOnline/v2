‘Sex and Puppets’ is reimagining the way we talk about sex. The show devised by the puppet company Wondering Hands uses a series of witty sketches - composed from verbatim transcripts of real life experiences - to explore different aspects of sex.

It is directed by Edie Edmundson, who I interviewed last year for Felix  when she was the lead puppeteer in the ‘Little Match Girl’ at the Globe. Edie hopes the show will help address the lack of proper sexual education given by the UK school system. She believes puppets make sex, a subject that is often obscured by analogy or misrepresented in pornography, more accessible.

I have first-hand experience of the sub-par sex education offered by the education system, having attended a faith school which believed repeatedly saying “don’t have sex before marriage” would adequately cover all the nuances of sexual education. It was therefore with considerable anticipation that I sat in a crammed People’s Theatre in Camden last Sunday, where the show would be on for one night as part of the hotbed festival of sex. I am happy to say it did not disappoint.

The performance was confident, well-choreographed and delicately handled a range of issues from first kisses to some rather unusual sexual kinks. But most importantly, it was also really funny. The venue perfectly suited the tone of the show. It was intimate and relaxed. Those at the front were only a few metres away from the puppets and the puppeteers, and this allowed a good deal of audience interaction. In the opening sketch, Fuzz, who looks a bit like a cross between a golden retriever and a pink muppet, pesters the front row to allow him to access 18+ material on his tablet. When he is finally granted access, he grunts and reclines, proceeding to enjoy the material with the assistance of an aubergine.
> > The puppets are rich characters, completely distinct from the humans on stage operating them
One of the best parts of the show was the interaction between puppets and puppeteers. In one of the sketches, the puppets - after declaring some bold sexual fantasy - turn and question their operators, who become comically shy and awkward. These scenes allow the puppets to grow as rich characters, distinct from the humans.

Another great aspect of this show is how visually pleasing it is. My favourite sketches were given by the puppets acting as STIs, who included chlamydia, crabs and genital warts. Someone at Wondering Hands has serious creative talent, and these puppets were skilfully designed; I’ve never seen crabs look so cute or genital warts so grumpy. I was also surprised at how effective the puppets were at giving medical advice. As a microbiologist I was heartened by the accuracy of what was said.

Reflecting on the whole performance, it is clear that Wondering Hands are doing something highly commendable. Puppetry is an excellent medium to discuss sexual issues. The way we associate puppets with childhood means that it catches us unaware to hear puppets discussing adult themes. We don’t bring our guard up in the same way we might do when serious looking professionals give us information about sex. By excising the awkwardness around the subject, it's much easier to engage with what is being said.

Edie hopes in time to tailor a more child-version friendly of the show that could be performed at schools. She tells me they have many sketches stored up, so it’s just about choosing the most appropriate ones. As it stands the next performances will be at Brainchild and Shambala Festival this summer and there are plans to tour the UK later this year. I urge all of you to seek this show out. There’s a lot to be learnt from sex and puppets.
