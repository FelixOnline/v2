Perhaps, everybody has Murphy in their life. Perhaps, many just do not notice it. Being a sensitive over thinker, I am always a little bit too aware ofMurphy and his quirky laws. Basically, the theory goes that anything that can go wrong will go wrong.

Murphy always seemed to be in the picture, and I would worry non-stop about what could go wrong, what will go wrong and how to deal with itwhen it does go wrong. A while back, I had to be responsible and sensible, strong enough to restrain and calm a very ill person, alongside attempting to predict and prevent all the ways that there would be evil in the world as a child. Yet, trying to be balanced enough to contemplate the arguments with my foster mum, on one important bit about the universe or the other and being told otherwise.

I’ll just pause here for a second. What about you? Just think of everything that has gone wrong in your life. On second thoughts, don’t. Think about everything in your life that has been a lesson. It’s strange right.

How do you feel with a saying from an Eastern Sage, who said “Why do you complain of the rub, that polishes you, my friend?’ Could it be that Mr Murphy is just a theoretical concept is inadvertently helping us become better people, in a transient life.
> ...believe that yesterday, today and tomorrow are simply the best days
I don’t know how it happened, or the moment when the weight from my shoulders was lifted and it felt like I could see clearly in the mist of reality. Occam’s razor (from my limited understanding) is the concept that in essence does not seek a complicated explanation, but gets rid of the unnecessary, and holds true to the most straightforward way of explaining things.

Don’t you see? Most people push away happiness but subconsciously hold onto it. What we don’t realize that happiness is here. Happiness is past, present and future, towards a tranquil horizon. A butterfly that comes and quietly sits by the shoulder, when we become too large for worry, too loyal for fickleness, too humble for arrogance, too funny for anger, too selfless for avarice, too brave to be to be influenced and too kind for jealousy.

One day I ran in the fields, and sat on branches that swayed in the wind, with the leaves a kaleidoscope of sunlight and green. I learnt that peace in all its definitions is a simple explanation for the inner soul, and the outer world.

Find your path. Try to simplify life, find the simplest explanation and the most positive. It will make a world of difference. You have far more important and beautiful days to be dazed by challenges and miracles.

Define what is important, let go of the unnecessary. Think for yourself and simplify everything, understand the core. To see the translucent and most positive, to see good in all and to believe that yesterday, today and tomorrow are simply the best days, is a little philosophy that leads to nothing going wrong and everything going right.
