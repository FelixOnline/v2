 - Another opportunity for Imperial Catering to continue their mission for world dominationWhen I came to Prince Eugeniusz Lubomirski  was a Chairman of the Club One could never imagine such  idea of a sale of a home for Polish people then even if they needed Help  and struggled as well These people  fought  for years to keep Polish Heart Club alive and our Chairman  finds it impossible to make this place profitable despite 2 biggest museums within 500 metres and proposes to sell   What a misery

A petition has been set up to save the Polish Club, Ognisko Polskie, based in Princes Gardens, which is at risk of being sold. The South Kensington club includes the Ognisko restaurant, popular with staff and students from Imperial.

Ognisko Polskie has existed for seventy-one years, promoting the Polish culture in London, and has held a range of cultural and social events including lectures, concerts and art exhibitions.

Jill Cook from Friends of Imperial College said, “The club is used by many Poles living in London as well as by other nationalities and by local residents in South Kensington, and it seems a pity that such a cultural and historical venue should no longer exist.”

She added that, “It is the only pleasant venue for meals and drinks close to Imperial College.”

The petition states that, “The proposed sale of the building will be an immense loss and damaging to the Polish Community. We feel that the directors of Ognisko Limited have not explored the full range of business options to make Ognisko Polskie financially viable once more.”

A decision will be taken at the AGM of the Polish club on 27 May which will seal the fate of the club.
