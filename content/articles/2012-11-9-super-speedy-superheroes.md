On a cold Wednesday afternoon Imperial’s finest runners headed off to Richmond Park for the second of our London College League races of the year. Since the race coincided with Halloween, club members stepped up to the mark with some spooky costumes to scare off the competition. We definitely deserved the prize for best dressed team.

Despite some transport issues causing the race to be delayed by half an hour, Imperial were ready to take on the 2.5 mile or 5 mile course. A chant of ‘Gary Hoare’ started the race which saw superwomen, Tony the Tiger and escaped zombies run off the start line. The men’s team were full of anticipation for the race ahead as they knew they could improve on the first race result.

An excellent run from first timer Faron Hesse meant he finished an incredible 4th position a mere 30 seconds behind the winner. The rest of the first men’s team also improved greatly with Phil McCorquodale, Sam O’Neill, Chris Thomas and Reuben Bogg all moving up 34, 17, 9 and 10 positions respectively. Special mention to Men’s Captain James Ellis who missed the start but still managed to bolt round to finish just in time to make the 1st team! Overall the Men’s Team moved up 2 places to finish an incredible 3rd position just behind St Marys, the second team also finished in 6th position.

In the women’s race, the first team improved on their score from last time, with Sophie Kirk, Josie Bowler and Imogen Keane finishing in 19th 20th and 21st position respectively. However the team remain in 5th position just 6 points down onBrunel. First timer Kimberley Mason had a great run to finish in 35th position, we look forward to watching her improve over the season.

Despite losing Tri Captain Ed Hallett on his first league race, we hope he comes back for more. A successful days racing was followed by some suitably spooky cakes, apple bobbing and much celebrating. We look forward to next week’s race and Wimbledon common where we hope both the men’s and women’s teams can finish in the top 3!
