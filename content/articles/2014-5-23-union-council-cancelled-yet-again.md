This Tuesday Union Council was cancelled due to failing to achieve quoracy again.

An email was sent around on Monday announcing the cancellation after an administrative member of staff received a large number of apologies of absence via email.

This is the second Union Council meeting to be cancelled this year, excluding the last meeting, which took place despite members not being able to vote (again due to lacking numbers).

With a disappointing amount of students representatives attending three of the ten Union Council meeting scheduled for the academic year, large number of issues will either be voted on by email, or pushed back to the last Council meeting of term (10th June).

The final Council meeting will also be the meeting where Council members vote to approve new “Higher Education” and “Access to Higher Education” policies for the Union, which will include a debate on which funding system students support.
