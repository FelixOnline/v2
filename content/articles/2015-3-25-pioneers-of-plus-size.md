Tess Munster, also known as Tess Holliday, has recently become the largest model ever to be signed to a major modelling agency, MiLK Model Management. Her size being a UK 22-24, and 5’5”, she describes herself as a “body-positive activist”, and is most well known for her #effyourbeautystandards movement, created to encourage larger women to accept and love themselves.

Despite being bullied for her appearance throughout her life, Tess started plus-size modelling when she left school. Now she is one of the most famous plus-size models in the world, with a huge following on Instagram. However, she experiences a vicious backlash on social media in response to each post, which accuses her of promoting an unhealthy lifestyle. Throughout this, Tess is an unfailingly positive presence on the internet.

She regularly hosts events all over the world to help women with their personal body acceptance. She was named one of the top plus-size models in the world by Vogue Italia; her career is spiralling wildly upwards, making history.
