     @Wiggo: That's what I meant/thought I said. As in, it now costs £2.40. Before the change in price it was £2.20. So it's changed from £2.20 to £2.40. Sorry if it wasn't clear! I think I need a pint now...,blatant profiteering from the Union again. They're using the removal of the 'entry' charge (which only applies to a few people, and I've always been able to avoid it when I've gone on days it applies for) as an excuse to charge us all more for drinks, and make more money out of us. <br> <br>Fleecing your members is not what a Students' Union is meant to be about ICU, and its best you don't forget that.,Thanks for pointing out the naming mess-up. I'll put my hands up and admit it was an honest mistake! It's been corrected now.,a) If you organised a one night only event with lots of people turning out, you probably can negotiate cheaper drinks than standard Union drinks. that's not exactly a huge surprise (although this is in theory because our union is more responsible about drinking than most bars... right?!).

Any student visiting the Union recently (possibly for celebrating/drowning your sorrows after resits over summer) may have noticed that the pricing has changed. For example, a pint of Stella now costs £2.40, whereas before it was £2.20, resulting in a rise of 9% (9.09 both recurring, to be precise – we are at Imperial after all).

The rise marks the second consecutive year of price rises. Last year, the prices were also increased. The raise was announced on Friday 23 September 2011 in a blog post by Michael Foster, outgoing Deputy President (Finance & Services). He wrote that it was "unfortunately unavoidable" as the prices did not go up the year before. The price increase was described at the time as having to account for the rise in VAT and inflation. He ended by saying: "Our goal, as always, is to provide you with great drinks at low prices in a fantastic bar that can be enjoyed by all."

Felix has been informed by Stefan Nubert, the incoming Deputy President (Finance & Services), that the change in price is permanent (i.e. not just for summer) and that the Union plans to announce the new prices later in the summer, as well as the reasoning for them.

_UPDATE: Apologies to both Stefan Bauer and Stefan Nubert for the slightly (read: very) embarrassing naming mishap. It has now been corrected._
