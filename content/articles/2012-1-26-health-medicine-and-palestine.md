Imperial College Palestinian Society had the privilege of hosting a talk by Dr. Mads Gilbert last Friday. Dr. Gilbert, a renowned Norwegian doctor, volunteered in Gaza in 2009; at a time when Gaza was under a dreadful invasion.

The talk, entitled ‘[The misuse of Health & Medicine in Palestine](http://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/whats-on/palestinian-society-mads-gilbert-on-the-misuse-of-health-medicine-in-palestine,1966,EV.html)’, brought the Gaza massacre vividly back to our memories. A minute of images under the sound of bombs and air attacks set the scene of fear and terror Palestinians lived through for three weeks. Dr. Gilbert; through his impressive speaking talent, was able to make the audience glimpse what living in Gaza was like at that point in its history, and highlighted the determination of the Palestinian people to survive and resist.

The story started with Kahlil, a Palestinian refugee in Lebanon, whose family was exiled in 1948 and forced to leave their homes. Khalil lost his arm and mother in the same explosion, when Lebanon was under attack by the Zionist state in 1982. Khalil did not give up and decided to help other Palestinians get through their traumatic experiences. Khalil suffered but remains determined to live.

Dr. Gilbert has always believed that medicine and politics are inseparable, and emphasised that it is the duty of doctors to speak out against genocide. These views have always been publicly expressed by Dr. Gilbert, though his rationale was rarely heard. Doctors have a duty to help people: it forms the core of their oath. The people of Gaza suffered due to military attacks, invasions and bombings. It was manmade guns and missiles that murdered the children, women and men of Gaza. Thus it was the duty of Dr. Gilbert, and indeed all doctors, to shout out to the world to stop the cause of this suffering.

Loay, a ten year old boy at the time, returned home to help his dad collect a few of their belongings after having had to leave their home in Beit Lahia. They were hit by a missile which killed his cousin. Loay survived but lost both of his eyes. Today, Loay lives with his family in a house where the kitchen, living room, bedroom are all the same room. Though Loay suffered, he remains optimistic and is very supportive of his younger siblings. Loay is determined to live.

The talk was very enlightening and thought provoking for all that attended. There were far too many matters and topics for me to discuss in this article, so I will finish as Dr. Gilbert finished his talk – there is something we can all do to help, no matter how small our contribution. And when there is occupation, there is resistance and determination, and those who seek justice never fail. One day there will be a Free Palestine.
