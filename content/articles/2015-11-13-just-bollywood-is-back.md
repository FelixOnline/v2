Just Bollywood – the nationwide fusion-dance competition organised by IndianSoc, is back!

After its wildly successful first year, the competition promises to be even more exciting and entertaining this time round. Ten teams across the country will be fighting to be crowned the Bollywood champions of the UK.

Each team is assigned a specific theme and a prop, to integrate creatively within their eight-minute set. The teams aim to explore a diverse range of dance styles, maintain execution and create dynamic formations, all whilst staying true to the colourful, extravagant nature of Bollywood.

You can definitely expect fierce competition, as this year the show will adopt a head-to-head format, with Team Imperial taking on Team Cambridge!

The 2014 Imperial JB team put on a spectacular performance last year, winning 1st place with their Bollywood adaptation of the classic movie Pretty Woman.

We hope the 2015 team can follow in their footsteps and defend our title. The next few weeks will consist of hard work, dedication and intense training. Led by the two captains Roshni Mitra and Trisha Ghosh, Team Imperial will be pulling out all stops to create another passionate, unforgettable performance. This year a pre-show mini round has been added, intensifying the competition further!

Each team has produced a short dance video, now live on the JB Facebook page, featuring a taste of the talent to come. The Imperial JB team needs your help to ensure our success during this first round: a simple Facebook like on our JB dance video is all it takes.

The team with the most likes on their video will be rewarded with an advantage on the day of the competition, so please do take a moment to visit the Just Bollywood Facebook page! Come support Team Imperial at the show on Sunday 13th December and see the talent from all over the country. With renowned judges and incredible performances, Just Bollywood will not disappoint. You can’t miss it!
