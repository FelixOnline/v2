Imagine the strength in the voice of Adele, the soul of Corinne Bailey Rae and the mellow vibe of Regina Spektor in one artist. Ever since starting her vocal career at the WOMAD festival in 2007, Sally Archer has performed in many gigs around the country and has recorded in Abbey Road Studios. Her songs include a selection of heartfelt melodies with beautiful piano and soulful guitar parts; and of course the wonderful blend of her voice can’t help but make you smile.

Sally’s first EP, _Wonder_, was released last May. The get-up-and-go title track has creative jazz-influenced rhythms and a warm, bright feel, while the beautiful ‘Gold’s Fool’ has a mellowness which makes the passion in Sally’s vocals stand out. The talent and charisma of her accompanying band of musicians shine through particularly in the title track and the last track, ‘Fearless’. Along with her well crafted blues-influenced music, the stories in Sally’s lyrics are deep, emotional and profoundly honest. As an artist, Sally has also made the album artwork herself. Overall, the EP has a charming quality to it with a lovely mix of colours, moods and sentiments.

Following her last stunning performance at The Cuban Bar on Wednesday, Sally will be coming to the Imperial College Union Level 1 to perform in a live lounge along with other artists, which is kicking off on Friday 16th March at 7pm (hosted by the Imperial College Christian Union).
