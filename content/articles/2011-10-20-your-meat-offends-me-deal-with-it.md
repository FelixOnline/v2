 - Shopping in Tesco isnt the food chain If you were out hunting your meat thats the food chain But since youre reading this youre probably at Imperial which means youre weak feeble and are in the library rather than in Richmond Park with a spear Tuck in to your library jacket potato We _are_ different to animals humans are moral beings animals arentI wouldnt discourage anyone from having a stab at writing practice is an essential part of improving  However I am afraid I must agree with many of the sentiments above  Although my own writing is far from perfect I feel sure that it is easy to go too far when you are writing what you think  For example if you tell your audience you know their feelings better than they do you have to know deepdown that what you are doing is immoral you are in serious danger of alienating them  Some writers eg David Mitchell and Victoria Coren amongst my heroes are able to get a good balance and essentailly make whoever is reading their stuff agr

I was eating my lunch in the JCR (two-bean goulash YUM! :D) and this random guy just comes and sits down next to me and starts devouring a greasy stinky burger. I asked him if he minded moving because I find the stench of cooked meat to be nauseating. As you may have guessed, I’m a vegan. When I see people eating meat, cheese, cake or any other food that has come from animals, I just feel sick. I’m not one of those in-your-face vegans, but I have my right to ask someone to move if they’re going to offend my beliefs. The guy rudely told me to f**k off, so I just moved to another table. I wasn’t going to stoop to his level so I just walked away. Always ignore a bully ;)

Anyway, I’m not here to preach, I just want to explain my views. If you eat stuff that comes from animals, you are wrong. I’m sorry, but you are. You can defend your actions as much as you like by saying that animals don’t have emotions or can’t feel pain, but they have rights and you are abusing them. Don’t worry, I’m not saying that you can’t eat meat because everyone has freedom, but you have to know deep-down that what you are doing is immoral.

No-one has asked animals if they can eat their meat or drink their milk. I don’t go around eating people’s babies because that would be frowned on and I would go to prison, but it’s no different to eating animals. The other day I was on my uncle’s farm when some chicks were hatching and I just couldn’t understand why anyone would want to murder those little cuties. When you look in their eyes there is something there, like an unexplainable connection. I think the baby chickens have just as much a soul as we do – along with loads of other animals.

Some people argue that eating the eggs of chickens (or ducks, or other birds) doesn’t harm them in anyway, but if you think about it, it’s sort of stealing. No-one has asked the chicken if you can take her eggs and I read this article once that said that they have tested chicken’s stress levels after stealing their eggs and it goes up! I don’t think I could eat an omelette knowing that there is a stressed chicken on my hands.

Anyway, that’s my little piece over. Like I say, I have opinions and I’m not expecting you to read my articles if you don’t like them, so there is no need to [post nasty comments about my articles on the Felix website](http://felixonline.co.uk/comment/1538/im-a-girl-with-opinions-just-deal-with-it/#commentHeader). I don’t mind constructive criticism, but I won’t read your abusive comments :)
