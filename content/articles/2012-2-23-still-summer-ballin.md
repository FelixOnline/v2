 - Since colleges withdrawal of their traditional 20000 contribution it looks like ticket prices are going to be a lot higher Paying 50 for what is essentially a cut price event doesnt seem promising to me Matt

This year’s Summer Ball is set to see all the fun of the fair, figuratively and financially, following the wise and not entirely unexpected decision to revert to a more traditional event than last year.

Deputy President (Finance & Services) Michael Foster [announced the latest plans](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/2209/black-tie-for-summer-ball/) (to bring back a black tie dress code and the option of a sit down formal dinner) at a meeting of Imperial College Union Council on Monday 13 February. The event is set to be held on Saturday 23 June. A preliminary budget has been approved, the current plan will be taken to the Finance & Risk Sub-Committee of the Union’s Trustee Board, and any changes will be reviewed by the Union’s Executive Committee. Steps are clearly being taken to ensure that the event is less susceptible to financial risk and loss.

The paper suggested that students should be involved “at all levels”. The aim of this appears to be to gain the attention, and raise the expectations, of the student body, in addition with increasing the transparency of the event itself. Currently, it appears to be working. Other than speculation over budget changes and an increase to proposed ticket prices (between £25 and £30 for entertainments only and between £5 and £7 for the after party) immediate feedback to the plans has been positive.

This is sensible, and in ways inevitable. Taking a risk on this year’s Summer Ball would have been wholly illogical. The debate and conversation that emerged after the controversial decision to have last year’s Summer Ball take the format of a festival with no compulsory formalwear was widespread. Any risk of fostering further discontent is something that ideally must be quashed.

At this moment in time, and with no fully concrete plans in place, it is hard to argue about what potential improvements could be made. That is to say, shy of an open bar (it has, after all, been a long time since the heady days of a £1 pint). Some have suggested one main headliner to cut down on the cost of various artists across stages, though two main acts on two stages with support is also a decent choice. The decision to take a more reserved standpoint on the running of this year’s event is for all intents and purposes, following last year, far wiser than persisting with something that breaks drastically from tradition.

Crowdpleasing is the name of the game all around. There is still some time until the main event, but the signs look promising. Tentative, but promising.
