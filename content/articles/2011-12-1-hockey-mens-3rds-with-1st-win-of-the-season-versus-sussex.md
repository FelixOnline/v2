__Hockey__

Men’s 3rd – 2
 Sussex 2nd – 1

To say that it has been a disastrous start to the season would be an understatement for the IC Hockey Men’s 3rd XI.

By losing their first four games they had already lost more times this season than in the entirety of the last. With relegation a shocking possibility, the team knew that they needed to register a win soon, which is exactly what they did against a shell-shocked Sussex 2nd XI.

Playing 4-4-2 with a diamond had not been working for IC who have been lacking an attacking edge all season. So with drastic times calling for drastic measures, the team changed to a 4-3-3 and within minutes of the push back this change almost reaped immediate rewards with SCID almost knocking in a loose ball but for good work by the Sussex keeper.

IC kept up this pressure throughout the first 10 minutes of the half, but after this period, the game started to turn. A break by Sussex into our D saw goal-keeper Sifter run out to make a fine goal-saving tackle, but severely injure his neck in the process.

After a lengthy injury time out, IC took too long to get back into the game and found themselves a goal down when the Sussex forward snuck in behind the otherwise excellent Eager Beaver and Fritzl to slot coolly past a helpless Sifter. Some more poor play from IC offered Sussex plenty of opportunities, but thankfully poor finishing kept the score at just 1-0 when going into half time.

An inspiring half-time team talk from Sifter rallied the troops, reminding the team to play simple hockey and show that they were better than their Sussex opposition. This, combined with the thought of losing all of the first five games of the season and the exuberant support of the Ladies 2s, saw IC push hard from the off in the second half.

Everything just seemed the click after half time. The midfield dynamo of Fresher Hemal, Designer V, and Aquaman dominated the opposition, leaving Cockerel, Fresher Ed, Pappity-Boopity-Popitty and Munter Gatherer to exploit the spaces behind the defence and provide golden opportunities for SCID.

It didn’t take IC long to draw level, when a surging run down the right by Cockerel found the stick of Designer V who laid the ball on a plate for SCID to finish off. With that equaliser going in, IC were very much on top, and had Sussex reeling. Wave after wave of IC attack failed to produce a goal until Bum Tablet caught one of Sussex forwards napping while on the ball, and produced a scintillating run, fluking his way past two defenders before getting barged off the ball and winning a short corner. From the resulting short, Fresher Hemal smashed the ball into the goal putting IC ahead.

Sussex were stunned and try as they could, they failed to muster much of a response with the IC defence pushing up high and snuffing out attacks before they could develop. It was a nervy end to the match though, as Sussex were awarded a short at the death but Gingypops stood up to the test and pressured the Sussex forward into a mistake.
