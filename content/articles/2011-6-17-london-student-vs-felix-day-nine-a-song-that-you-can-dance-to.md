You may have noticed that [this is the second Star Slinger tune](http://felixonline.co.uk/music/1238/london-student-vs-felix-day-three--a-song-that-makes-you-happy/) so far. (He's basically [my favourite artist](http://felixonline.co.uk/music/1262/star-slinger/) in recent memory.) The beat on this refix makes it the most danceable music that I have ever heard.

_The London Student and Felix are [currently fighting an epic war](http://felixonline.co.uk/music/1210/london-student-vs-felix-30-day-challenge/). Like, tweet, or comment on this page to help us win today's battle. Tomorrow is 'A song that makes you fall asleep' – help us choose by posting your suggestions below._
