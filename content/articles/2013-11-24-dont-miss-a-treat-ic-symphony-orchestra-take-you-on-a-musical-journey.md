If you’ve never seen Imperial College Symphony Orchestra play, you’re missing out! Full of science-loving musicians, ICSO is Imperial’s flagship orchestra playing great music to the highest standards.
 After the success of playing to a sold out Cadogan Hall last year with the stunning BBC Young Musician 2012 Laura van der Heijden, ICSO have begun this year with the fabulous annual weekend trip to Dorchester. Staying with amazingly generous host families, ICSO performed alongside the Thomas Hardye Singers before introducing our new members to the wonderful Dorchester night life!

Our first South Kensington Concert is on Friday 29th November 2013 in the Great Hall at 8pm. Tickets cost just £3 for students in advance and are available from the Blyth Centre on Level 5 of the Sherfield building.

Alongside a jazz clarinet concerto performed by the phenomenal Chaz Keiderling (one of the winners of Imperial’s Concerto Competition), ICSO will also be playing the epic Rachmaninov Symphony No.2 – the perfect programme to take you away from your manic week of work, it is guaranteed to be a night to remember!

Yet this is just the start! Next term will see ICSO perform Britten’s War Requiem with IC Choir in Winchester Cathedral, as well as four more concertos from Imperial College performers. In the summer, ICSO have been invited to perform a concert in aid of UNESCO in Sibelius Hall, Finland – providing the base for a very exciting Summer Tour to Helsinki!

We hope to see you on the 29th November and feel free to get in contact at icso@imperial.ac.uk if you’d like to stay in touch with our events or have any questions!
