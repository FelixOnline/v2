The Imperial Baseball and Softball club played a league game against Oxford a few weekends ago. Many of the club’s players were unavailable that weekend though, so Daniel Kok borrowed a friend from his old university’s baseball team to fill in for the game. Despite this legitimate substitution, the team was still one player short of a full team. 

The game begun and Oxford came out strong in the top of the first inning, scoring five runs against Imperial. Despite the pressure put on the team, the Imperial Falcons had faith in themselves to level the score, “I hope Daniel gets struck out so I don’t have to bat next” said Jake Lee. Jake’s optimism carried him to first base, thus passing the pressure to Jonathan Cheung who was making his first plate appearance since accidentally scoring a run for UCL. Discovering abilities never seen before in training, Jonathan swung hard and sent the ball deep into outfield to bat in the boys on the bases. The score was now tied 5-5.

Joe Coulson pitched a flawless second inning to deny Oxford from scoring any runs. Veteran Edo Lisi scored soon after to take the lead for the Falcons. From Imperial’s fielding, you could barely tell that they were a man down.  Silky double plays were being made and bullets were being thrown by Kaptain Kok and Andrew Counsell to first baseman Joe Ronan. Hours of the ‘training drill’ pepper had paid off; everyone was getting hits and runs to maintain Imperial’s lead.

However, Oxford picked up 4 runs in their last half inning. Imperial’s 3 run lead had become a one run deficit. Though, Joe Coulson stole his way round the bases to score a game saving run. Two outs, the last inning, and the scores tied... Jonathan found himself at the plate again. With the fate of the game (and a 100% regulation baseball bat) in his hands, he waited for the right pitch before making a huge hit to centre field. Described by Edo as a “magnificent walkoff”, this clutch hit meant the Imperial Falcons had stolen the win from Oxford at the very last second! Despite his Valiant effort, Jonathan failed to score any runs for himself this game. He blames Joe Ronan for getting struck out at crucial moments. Joe was forgiven when the team found out his lung collapsed mid game.

Unfortunately the score to the second game was lost somewhere on the trek home from Harlington and the writer cannot remember who won. Joe Ronan also does not remember the score, but commented that “this (lung collapse) is bants, we beat Oxford with one less player and one less lung”.
