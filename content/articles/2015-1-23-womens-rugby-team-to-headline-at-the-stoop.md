     I've never read such an unenthusiastic, under researched and inaccurate article in the felix. I'm disappointed this opportunity to showcase a fantastic up and coming sport has been slightly wasted. Women's rugby is a fast paced and tactical game and in lots of ways very different to watch and play than the men's game. I personally find it way more exciting to watch and hope all imperial students at varsity enjoy watching as I will!,fitflops store <br>fitflop australia sale http://australiafitflops.iemiller.net/,fitflops australia <br>fitflop discount http://australiafitflops.iemiller.net/,shoes birkenstock <br>birkenstock online sale http://birkenstockaustralia.rochecap.org/,discount birkenstock <br>birkenstock sale online http://birkenstockaustralia2013.blogspot.com/,christian loubitin <br>christian louboutin sale canada http://christianlouboutincanadaoutlet.blogspot.com/,louboutin sneakers <br>christian louboutin http://christianlouboutincanadaoutlet.blogspot.com/,Tim Tebow did things which have never been done attending sch

The Women’s Rugby team have been asked to play their Varsity match after the JPR Williams Cup at the Stoop in Twickenham. The match, which will take place on 18th March, will be contested with ten players a side. It will be 20 minutes each way, to form a 40-minute match. The logistics of the rest of the day, such as timings, aren’t known yet, but it is believed that the men’s match will be first, and the women will headline afterwards.

The captain of Women’s Rugby, Mona Theodoraki, said of the event “This is a great opportunity for women’s rugby and for women’s sports in general. Hopefully it’ll inspire more girls to join and help the club grow. Just hoping people won’t head to the bar the second our match starts though.”

Last year the Imperial College Medicals side were triumphant in the women’s fixture, winning 26-10, which served as sweet revenge for the 26-5 reverse they suffered in 2013.

The Stoop is the home of Harlequins FC and has played host to many high profile matches. Next month, they will host the England Women’s Team as they play Italy. The England Women’s team won the Rugby World Cup in 2014.
