[__The Cabin in the Woods__](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1259521/)

__Director __Drew Goddard
__Screenwriters__ Joss Whedon, Drew Goddard
__Cast Kristen __Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Jesse William, Fran Kranz, Anna Hutchison

Usually, I am not a fan of horror movies, but knowing that this was written by Joss Whedon – the genius behind _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ – was enough to make me risk potential nightmares and watch it. And I’m glad I did – even though I haven’t really been able to sleep since.

Together with Drew Goddard, Whedon has brought audiences a retelling of a classic horror story, with numerous modern and humorous twists. For those unfamiliar with the tale – a group of people (generally teenagers or ridiculously hot young adults) go to a deserted cabin in the woods for a weekend getaway, but not everyone manages to come back home as they are soon killed off by some crazy woodfolk. I can’t really give away much more of the plot, as the best thing about this movie is not quite knowing what exactly you’re getting yourself into.

Shot back in 2009, the release date of the movie was pushed back indefinitely due to financial difficulties at MGM Studios. Being aware of the fate of many of Whedon’s projects, I had pretty much given up hope that this would ever make it to cinemas, and so was pleasantly surprised when the promotional posters first appeared. The success – both critical and commercial – of the film is, in my opinion, not that surprising, as Joss Whedon doesn’t do anything by halves and audiences can once again expect a viewing experience that is equal parts original, intelligent, satirical and comical. The laugh-out-loud moments were my favourite part of the movie, as they gave the whole thing a very surreal feel while also allowing me to calm down after a jump-out-of-my-seat scene.

I might be exaggerating the overall scariness of the movie (please bear in mind that I’m a bit of a wimp), so don’t let that put you off watching this. It is definitely nowhere near as scary as _The Woman in Black_, for example. The characters are genuinely entertaining – especially Marty (Kranz from_ Dollhouse_) – and you’re kept guessing until the very end of the movie as to what is really going on. Goddard, who has previously worked with Whedon on _Buffy_ and J.J. Abrams on _Lost_, makes his directorial debut and does a fine job.

Described by Whedon as a ‘critique of what we love and hate about horror movies,’ the film manages to have copious amounts of blood and gore without making viewers uncomfortable. The ending felt a bit rushed, but it was still completely unexpected. Fans of Whedon’s previous works will be pleased with this offering, whilst – I hope – newcomers will also appreciate his oftentimes undervalued talent as a storyteller. _The Cabin in the Woods_ might not be for everyone, but I for one thought it was good fun and recommend it if you enjoy movies that are unafraid to take risks and that are not at all how they appear to be at first glance.
