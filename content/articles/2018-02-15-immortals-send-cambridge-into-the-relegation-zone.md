The Imperial Immortals capitalized on their new-found momentum by punishing a tired Cambridge team to a 20-0 defeat, and sending them into the relegation zone.

The Imperial Immortals came out looking strong with a big turnout for this game after nearly losing the last face-off against the Cambridge Pythons due to an injury-stricken team. All players were rested and hungry for a second victory against the Pythons after such a close call last time the two teams met.

> “The game had a slow start, with both offenses taking heavy penalties and making errors”

The game had a slow start with both offenses taking heavy penalties and making unforced errors, while both defences made sure to keep the other team humble. There were several close calls for the Immortals in the first three quarters of play with running back Song “more fumbles than MVPs” Zhai making incredible yardage and leaving the Cambridge defence stunned on many offensive plays. 
As the Immortals headed into the fourth quarter with the game tied up at 0-0, mother Harlington brought about a surge of vigour and determination to defend the runway with hail and snow. As the hail carried on so did Ben “no daddy issues” O’Brien making plays all the way from our 20-yard line to the Pythons end zone (plays which landed him the offensive MVP for the game). He sure picked a good game to invite his girlfriend to come down and watch. With this drive putting the Immortals 6-0 up, hope for a Pythons victory was withering away. As the quarter continued, another brilliant drive by the offense left the immortals at 1st and goal against the Pythons. The immortals capitalised on this with the O-line led by Dan “4 more years 1 less groin” Grumberg paving the way for Ben to score another touchdown. 

As the offense powered through the fourth quarter so did the defence. The Python’s offense crumbled under the pressure from our defensive line with Deji “0 trainings, 1 girlfriend, 4 sacs” Adeboye making great plays against their quarter back. The Immortals defence also saw stellar plays all game from Ben “new phone who dis” Retter who impressed coaches on his first game appearance, landing him the defensive MVP. As the defensive pressure increased, the Pythons fumbled the ball into the end zone for a late quarter touchdown by Harry “stop winning MVPs I’m running out of bant” Lawrence. Harry then capitalized on this defensive play by scoring the two-point conversion with the offense on the same drive. Executions such as this landed Harry his 7th Overall MVP of the season.
