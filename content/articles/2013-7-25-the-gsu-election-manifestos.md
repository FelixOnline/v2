For those of you who are blissfully unaware, the Graduate Students Union (formerly the GSA) elections are being held this week, although you wouldn't know it. There's a significant lack of social media campaigning, especially the usually active #voteicu twitter hashtag which normally chirps every few minutes. Aside from sending out emails and updating the online manifestos, there hasn't been much activity from the Union either, not even a change of dates for the election timetable!

So for all of you last minute postgraduate voters who plan to get your vote in before the looming Friday deadline, Felix presents an easy to read list of nominees and manifestos!

Go to <https://vote.union.ic.ac.uk> to vote now!

P.S. It's really easy, there's not much to read...
