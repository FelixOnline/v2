Grand Theft Auto online finally enables you to play Grand Theft Auto how you want. Enabling you to create your character and setting you free on Los Santos to progress as you see fit. Here is one account of what goes down online.

First of all I made my character, a sweet Vince Neil surfer looking type with some serious attitude called Freddie, and then I dived straight into the game. At first things look good for Freddie, I win my first race earning me some cash and a chance to give the one finger salute to the people I beat. I then proceed to steal some meth from a biker gang and sell it on, and then protect a block of flats from a gang attack. However things were too good to be true (well to be fair that was the tutorial) and I discovered the true nature of Los Santos the harsh way. I buy a cheap apartment opposite a local skate park and kit out my garage with some vehicles. I go for a bright pink mini and a motorbike for speedy transport in style.

Freddie is in the most dangerous gang (created by me) Danger Chicken. The one goal of Danger Chicken is simple; set up a rival fried chicken company to Cluckin’ Bell. Obviously to do this we need money and the easiest (and only way I’ve discovered) way to make money is to steal, cheat, race and kill for it. Joining me in this pursuit is Anna Tilton, a high class lady with a serious taste for revenge. Once me and Anna were cruising around and got into a gang attack Anna went crazy, got in a tank and chased the poor guy across the map, killing them over and over so that they were never alive for more than 7 seconds at a time. As part of the gang I obviously had to back her up. When the enemy escaped and managed to get a tank, I promptly stole it off them and aided in the attempt to get them to leave the server which happened after a brutal one hour chase across the map. Needless to say Anna is a great friend to have. Her high rank gives me access to fun equipment such as tanks and air strikes. Unfortunately the only time I have seen an air strike is when I was blown to pieces when riding around on my bmx bike which I now know is not a safe thing to do.

The next adventure of Freddie is when I was challenged to an arm wrestle. Of course I accepted and beat this kid at an arm wrestle. I was expecting 5 or 6 arm wrestles for my troubles to get all the way cross the map, but they left after one. The only sensible thing to do was to repeatedly kill this guy to teach them a lesson. It was a bizarre chase as my mini was all beat up and they were in a sports car, but I somehow managed to keep up and keep the deaths up. He then tried to escape on foot which provided even more fun as I managed to run him over and fling his body all the way down a hill. Unfortunately all this ended in me getting a massive bounty from the police and I was repeatedly killed by other players.

I guess this shows that in Los Santos you got to be as Big Smoke says “Ice Cold”. Tune in next week for the account of Anna and Freddie, proud members of Danger Chicken, as they attempt to steal a Cluckin’ Bell van!
