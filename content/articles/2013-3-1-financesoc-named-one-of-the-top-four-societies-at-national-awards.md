Last week, [Imperial College’s Finance Society](https://www.union.ic.ac.uk/scc/finance/) (ICFS) was named one of the top four student societies in the country by Rate My Placement. This was the only Imperial society representing Imperial at the National Placement & Internship Awards 2013. ICFS was recognised for “outstanding commitment to generating opportunities for students – going above and beyond to balance the needs of corporate sponsors and students.”

ICFS has over 30 sponsors, 3000 members and have organised over 50 events this year. The society is led by Giri Kesavan and Deepka Rana, the magnitude of activities in a small committee of eight people was praised. The tailored sponsorship offered by ICFS and the informal feel were recognised as the key strengths of the society, which is an innovative ethos for a Finance Society.
