For Imperial’s ﬁrst match there couldn’t have been much of a better way to start the Hurling season. With blue skies and a light breeze in Greenford the boys in blue new they were in for something good.

Despite Oxford not getting a team, there was a good showing from St Mary’s, Cambridge and Lakenheath, who are made up of US Air Force pilots (I know!).

It was decided that St Mary’s and ourselves should play as a joint team, which is what we are doing for Championships, against a mixed team of Cambridge and Lakenheath in a 60 minute, 13-aside match.

The match began with a shaky start for both sides as the players got to know the teammates in their joint team. Once the ball got rolling it became clear that the London side were the dominant force. With some spectacular defending by Neil Clancy and Paul McGovern, Cambridge found it hard to get near the AllStar Hurler Stevie Gallagher, who was stuck in goals through injury but managed some great saves. When the ball did go wide Stevie’s poc-outs were literally hit or miss, due to “the wind”. In mid-field Jack McCaughan and Keith made impressive runs and scored some points from distance. Despite not being able to run at all, St. Mary’s fresher and U-21 Tyrone footballer Ryan poached like a pro and kicked as many points and goals as he pucked. He racked up an impressive score line.

Cambridge showed some promise at the start of the second half with two goals and a point, but London got back in gear and started to dominate again. They were boosted by the presence of Donal McCann, St Mary’s Captain; he put a few great shots over the bar. With the London forwards seeing the majority of the ball Jerome Scullion, clearly a bit rusty after his 5 years in Borstal for stealing dusties, and John McGuckin created a few penalties and 65’s, which were converted.

Sean Dunne in centre half forward made some good catches, but showed he was a footballer when it came to hitting the ball. His frustration was unleashed on an unsuspecting American when he was fouled. London continued to dominate until the final whistle.

With a few pints in the bar, Imperial and the Mary’s lads agreed that the test drive of the amalgamated team had been successful, looking forward to next Saturday when we hope to bring it to the Northern and Scottish Universities who don’t know what’s coming!
