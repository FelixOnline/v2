The ICT Service Desk over on Level 4 Sherfield is a busy place. In fact it’s where all of Imperial’s students and staff get assistance with IT and the small but efficient team that is the Service Desk handle over 6000 requests per month to keep everyone working.

For students in particular, if your laptop is running slow, virus-infected or just not working as it should be, bring it along for us to have a look at and book it in to our Laptop Surgery Service.

Likewise, if you have any other questions regarding your email, home directory (aka H:drive), wireless network or one of the many online services, you can pop up and have a chat to get you back up and working.

Here at the Service Desk we believe IT should be helpful rather than a hindrance and without wanting to sound like the world-dominating supermarket, we’re here to help. Oh and it’s also a free service – now, you can’t argue with that!
