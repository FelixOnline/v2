Julian Fellowes, creator of Downton Abbey, visited Imperial College on Friday 6th February for a tour of the research labs and also met with the College President, Professor Alice Gast. Their tour finished with a trip out on Jezebel, the RCSU’s fire engine mascot, who appeared in Downton Abbey last September.

Lord Fellowes and his wife visited South Kensington last Friday, where they visited the Royal British Legion Centre for Blast Injury Studies. The Centre is run as collaboration between military and civilian scientists into the reduction and treatment of injuries caused by blast waves, such as those produced by IEDs or landmines.

As part of the tour, Lord and Lady Fellowes meet with various Master and PhD students who are investigating how the loading and strains produced by blast waves effect cells and biological tissue.

The end of the visit culminated on a trip out on Jezebel. The 1916 fire engine driven by current 4th year student, Ellis Hudson, took the Fellowes for a drive through Kensington and Hyde Park. Despite the cold weather, Julian Fellowes described the ride as “big finish to the morning – so thrilling. The clanging of the bell is something that brings out the child in all of us I think!

Jezebel appeared in the latest season of Downton Abbey, starring as the Downton Estate Fire Engine. Members of RCS Motor Club, the student society who look after Jezebel, were involved as extras on the show. A spokesman for the Club said that: “Lord Fellowes wasn’t there during the filming with Jezebel, so we are really glad that we got to introduce him to her today after her starring role in the show!”
