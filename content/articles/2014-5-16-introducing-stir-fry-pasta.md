Sharing the Cheah family recipe:

Quick, tasty and different!

Boil the pasta until al dente. Try buying good quality pasta, otherwise it is more likely to stick and become a mush when you stir fry it. Drain and reserve the starchy water.

Fry minced garlic in a drop of oil until fragrant - be careful not to let it brown! Then add sliced bacon and chicken (or whatever meat you want to add). Then add your choice of vegetables - here we have carrots, peppers and broccoli. You might need some of that starchy water to help it soften. Don’t be scared to add a bit more oil at this point, you need just enough to coat the pasta to make it tasty!

Add some mixed dried herbs, pasta and some shrimp chilli flakes to taste! You can buy them from oriental supermarkets or make your own by crushing dried shrimps with crushed chilli and leave for a few days.

You can add a bit of mushroom bouillon if you want to enhance the flavour. And it’s done!
