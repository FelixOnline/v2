We’ve officially launched the sex survey 2015!

We’ve brought back the classics such as where you’ve had sex on campus, the official National Student Sexual Satisfaction Survey (so much better than the NSS) and added in some new extras, such as porn preferences, long distance relationship stats and many more.

Questions reveal themselves based on previous responses, but the survey shouldn’t take longer than five to ten minutes. It doesn't work too well on phones though, so maybe wait until you are behind a computer to fill it all in.

All responses are kept anonymous, every question has the option to not respond to it and in general it is meant to be a laugh, depending on how hilarious you find it recounting all your various sexual experiences.

The free text box at the end is for any other comments you would like to make about your sex life, to tell us any funny sex stories or even just moan about the lack of lovin’ going on in the library.

Are you as excited as we are?

Take it now and keep your eyes peeled for the results later on in the term!
