Cardiff vs Swansea
 (Sunday 4pm, Sky Sports 1)

David Marshall’s heroics in goal have won Cardiff several points so far and the Bluebirds will be hard to break down again, but, without midweek Europa League commitments, Michael Laudrup can galvanise the Swans to earn bragging rights in Wales.
 Prediction: 0-1

Everton vs Tottenham
 (Sunday 1:30pm, Sky Sports 1)

It is remarkable how Roberto Martinez has managed to improve the side he inherited from David Moyes. On a shoestring budget, he has engineered numerous successful summer signings and the Lukaku loan deal was a real coup. Spurs have been solid but not spectacular recently so I am backing a repeat of last year’s scoreline here. Back Lukaku to feature on the scoresheet.
 Prediction: 2-1

Arsenal vs Liverpool
 (Saturday 5:30pm, Sky Sports 1)

Offensively, both these sides have been outstanding so far, as reflected by their commanding positions in the league. However, Liverpool are not insurmountable away and have conceded 5 goals in the last 3 matches, while Arsenal lost at home to Dortmund and looked a little vulnerable against Crystal Palace. This should be a fascinating contest and I can’t call whether Suarez and Sturridge or Giroud and Ozil will be the difference.
 Prediction: 1-1

Newcastle vs Chelsea
 (Saturday 12:45pm, BT Sport 1)

The Magpies would probably benefit from lining up defensively against Chelsea, who have come out on top in open, expansive games against Norwich and Cardiff recently, as well as in Europe. But their own strengths lie in attack with Remy, Cabaye and Ben Arfa so Alan Pardew has a decision to make. In front of 52,000 Geordies, I expect him to play a high line and for Newcastle to be picked off on the break.
 Prediction: 1-2

Best of the rest
 (Saturday 3pm unless stated)

Fulham vs Man United

Craven Cottage is not the easiest place to go, but David Moyes simply cannot afford to drop more points here. It is in defence that United have mostly struggled, so it’s just as well that their Crystal Palace win aside, Fulham’s own strikeforce has not really clicked into gear.
 Prediction: 1-2

Hull City vs Sunderland

The Tigers have been solid at home all season and Gus Poyet has yet to inject the necessary belief in his players to convince me they can add to their solitary point so far.
 Prediction: 1-0

Man City vs Norwich

 Norwich had 31 shots against Cardiff and have the necessary guile to cause Joe Hart real problems. However, Man City are clearly home bankers and rightly so – no team in the Premier League possesses a more potent attack if things ever get hairy.
 Prediction: 3-1

Stoke vs Southampton

Saints have a fantastic core of Lovren, Fonte, Schneiderlin and Wanyama, which allows them to play a pressing game to great effect, especially away. The Potters showed uncharacteristic flair at Old Trafford but the Britannia is no longer the fortress it once was.
 Prediction: 0-1

West Brom vs Crystal Palace

Although Palace showed signs of character and commitment against Arsenal, they still look like a Championship side. Luis Suarez disposed of West Brom last time out but the Baggies are a powerful, attacking side and should have far too much.
 Prediction: 2-0

West Ham vs Aston Villa

West Ham have already lost 3 home matches this season and are hard to back with so few fit strikers. Villa perform better away and have Christian Benteke to break down the Hammers defence. They are due a result too.kick-started Swansea’s season.
 Prediction: 1-0
