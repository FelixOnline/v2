The James Dyson Foundation has set up a £1 million scholarship scheme for postgraduate design and engineering students. The Dyson vacuum cleaner creator said that engineering needed to be promoted to help the UK’s economic recovery.The donation will be used to fund four postgraduate bursaries of £25,000 per year for students at Imperial, Bath, Bristol and Corpus Christi Cambridge, awarded on the basis of “passion” for engineering, academic ability and financial need.
