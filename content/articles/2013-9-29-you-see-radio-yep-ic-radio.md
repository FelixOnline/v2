You have a student radio station. It’s in Beit’s West basement, just next to the Felix office and to be frank, it’s pretty awesome. We have about 10,000 CDs and vinyls down there, we host live bands from our recording studio (yep, got one of them too) and you can have listen at www.ICRadio.com.
 The best thing about us, is that any of you can come and join in, whether you want to host your very own show, make our website even more awesome, commentate at the upcoming Medics v College rugby match or go to gigs backstage and review them for us (for free of course), we need your help!

This is the best time you could possible chose to get involved with us. Freshers’ Week will be our biggest yet, we are hosting live bands atboth Freshers’ Mingles and the Freshers’ Ball (we hope you enjoy them!) and this term we want to fill out our schedule with all of your brilliant talent. At the end of this year, we will say a sad farewell to the studio as it all gets refurbished into a brand new, state of the art studio in time for October 2014.

If you want to get involved in Imperial’s most fun, wide ranging and funky society, get yourself to our Freshers’ Fair stand. Failing that, we are hosting our annual ‘Beer and Biscuits’ welcome event on the 7th October in the Physics common room at 7 o’clock. Grab a couple of friends and come and drink some of our (free) drinks, eat our food and listen to good music. See you there!
