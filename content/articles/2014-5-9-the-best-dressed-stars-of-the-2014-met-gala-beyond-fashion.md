On Monday night the most exclusive fashion event of the year took place in New York City, and its famous guests wowed us with their style.

This years Met Gala theme, Charles James: Beyond Fashion, gave guests the opportunity to dress over the top! From Lupita Nyong’o’s flapper girl Prada ensemble to Kendall Jenner’s oppulent jewel toned gown, here are the highlights from the night.

Zoe Saldana

The 35 year old actress looked stunning in this Michael Kors dress with Jack Vartanian jewels. Some say she looked like a tacky lampshade, but I think she looks gorgeous.

Kendall Jenner

Kim Kardashian’s younger sister stunned in a light pink topshop gown at her first Met Ball appearance. The 18 year model has such a thin figure that she could look wearing a brown paper bag! She is hands down the winner of the best dressed title this year.

Lupita Nyong’o

Some say that Lupita’s Prada look was too over the top, but I think she looked fabulous in her flapper girl inspired dress. Critics forget that the theme of the ball was ‘Beyond Fashion’! She definitely dressed the part.

Hailee Steinfeld

Hailee Steinfeld channeled understated chic in her Prabal Gurung black and white gown. Her satin Charlotte Olympia shoes polished off the look. It would have bee nice to see more jewelery on her to dress up the look, but otherwise, the 17 year-old pulled off the mature look.

Emma Stone

Emma Stone chose to be alternative and wore a Thakoon crop top and skirt instead of a ball gown, teamed with a Tod’s clutch. The two tones of pink looked very pretty on her fair skin, but the look was a bit casual for THE fashion event of the year!

Lea Michele

Did Lea Michele dress like an Oscar? The glee star shone in this golden gown by Joseph Altuzarra. Metro online put her on their worst dressed list, but Oscar looke...woops, I mean Lea, looked fabulous in the shimerring dress.
