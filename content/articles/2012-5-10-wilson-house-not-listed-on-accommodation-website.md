     K, Waterloo isn't exactly far away, save money, get a bike! <br>£200 is ridiculous money though, more than twice as much as i paid in fisher two years ago. <br>Glad I'm not a fresher next year, would have to sell a kidney I think.,£130-£140 pw, is that even affordable on student loans? The main reason I and many others chose Wilson was because of the cost of the rooms being the most reasonable in 2007 entry, and I even remember one of the terms being a tight squeeze to pay the terms rent on the loan alone. <br> <br>Seems Imperial assume everyone has parents who will subsidise their rents and for many this isn't true.,It's bad enough the fees are high next year, I feel sorry for those paying £200 a week plus tube fares to get to lectures. Too expensive in my opinion.,Disaster. Wilson's the cheapest you can go for single rooms, and it's brilliant. Pretty sure they're undermining a large number of undergrads looking for less spanking new/overpriced accommodation. <br>A shame.,I was strapped for cash paying £155 for Orien

Wilson House has been removed from Imperial College’s accommodation website for prospective students. In February, it was [reported](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/2152/wilson-review-could-lead-to-rehousing/) in Felix that the hall could potentially be closed for refurbishment for the 2012-2013 academic year.

A new hall of residence, named ‘[Xenia](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/accommodation/prospectivestudents/prospectiveundergraduatestudents/hallsofresidenceug/xenia)’ has appeared on the website. Situated in Waterloo, the accommodation website states that the hall has “recently undergone extensive refurbishment and is located in the ‘cultural heart’ of London”. En suite single rooms cost from £170-£200 per week, standard single rooms from £130-£140 per week, and twin rooms from £110-£170 per student per week. In comparison, a standard single room cost from £104.08 per week at Wilson House.

Previously, the warden of Wilson House, Dr Michael Bluck, said that “Should closure of Wilson be required (whenever that may be), other halls would likely be needed temporarily, in order to meet the guarantee we make to first year undergraduates.”

Felix will have a more detailed report on this story next week.
