__Tokyo University 1st XV 32____
__

__ICURFC 1st XV 7__

The second game day of the IC Ninja’s tour of Japan began a much like the first. Weary, hungover bodies dragged themselves across the whitewash, expectant. Unfortunately, the similarities end here. With two play makers, Brown and Chalke, injured as well as prop Alldridge the Ninjas were forced to make changes. Burge stepped up at 10, Thomas in the centre and Spittle at loosehead.

The Ninja’s could not have asked for a better start to the game. Within seconds Tokyo University found themselves one man down and pinned in there own half following a dangerous challenge. The offender (their open side flanker) left the field smiling and bowing apologetically, a fine example of the Japanese’ highly courteous culture. Unfortunately the reaction of the recipient appeared to take the polar opposite with Captain Cotter seemingly moments from eruption for the remainder of his time on the field. Setting the trend for the rest of the game Imperial didn’t manage to capitalise on this initial advantage and found themselves immediately on the back foot after committing an offence at the resulting maul.

It was Tokyo who got on the scoresheet first, converting a penalty in front as a result of the Imperial back-line creeping offside. Tokyo soon added to their tally with a well worked forwards try. Again the Ninjas indiscipline let them down conceding a penalty and a lineout deep in their 22. The militarily drilled Tokyo pack kept tight to push over from close range. The score, 10-0.

The next 15 minutes was a complete a scrum fest, with both teams making error after error. At this point Imperial managed to string together their longest passage of play so far. A good lineout and a fizzing flat ball from scrum half Cox put open side Pettit through a hole who then neatly executed a two-on-one with the full back for back row counterpart Johnstone to score. 10-7.

Soon after, Imperial had the opportunity to draw level with a penalty in front of the posts, although from far out. Burge stepped up to the plate backing himself to have the distance. Admittedly he did have it, however the usually accurate kicker miscued, knocking the ball closer to the touchline than the posts. Opportunity squandered.

The next score came again from Tokyo. Working their way in to Imperial territory after numerous kick exchanges the Imperial defence was opened up with a very well placed cross field kick. The referee, from 30m away, decided that the Tokyo player got downward pressure before the covering winger James, taking the score to 17-7 before the half time whistle.

Imperial played the second half with all the flair and none of the efficiency of a German rugby machine. Add to this the indiscipline of a grumpy teenage girl on her period and you have a recipe for shit, which is exactly what we got.

Imperial barely ventured out of their own half and felt the pressure of the well drilled Tokyo side. Eventually the superior kick chase of the Japanese team paid dividends and Tokyo found themselves in a good position and capitalised with another close range try. Tokyo scored a further try finding themselves with an overlap on the left after several phases.

With ten minutes to go Imperial lost all composure and continual indiscipline came to a head with yellow cards for Toby Spittle and soon after Caolan Cotter, adding to Imperials already mounting woes. The final score ended a disappointing 32-7.

Once again the host team put on a brilliant spread of food and drink and introduced us to some new Japanese drinking games. Many thanks go to Tokyo University for a tough test and generous hospitality. Next challenge, Osaka PE.
