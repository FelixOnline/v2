On Tuesday the RCSU (Royal College of Science Union) celebrated the introduction to the next RCSU Science Challenge Competition with a launch event in the Sir Alexander Fleming Building.

As well as prospective entrants from Imperial and several secondary schools the event also played host to an influential panel of judges and speakers, including Professor Fay Dowker, Professor of Theoretical Physics and former student of Stephen Hawking, Baroness Eliza Manningham-Buller DCB, Chair of Imperial College Council and Former Director General of MI5, and Pallab Ghosh, BBC News Science Correspondent and former Felix Editor.

The winners of the competition will be chosen separately from Imperial students and secondary school students. For the essay questions, the Imperial overall winner receives £1000 and a trip to CERN while each question winner received £400. For school essays, the overall winner wins £500 and a trip to CERN while the winners for each question receive £200. Instead, for the video question, the overall winner wins £1000 while the Imperial and School runner ups each receive £200.

At the launch event the audience were treated to short talks from each of the judges, who discussed the importance of communicating science to a wider audience and imparted several nuggets of wisdom to the captive audience.

The competition will be open to students from February 1 to March 3, 2014 and each entrant will be able to select a single question from the competition.
