     There's nothing cool about supporting an organisation who subvert democracy at every turn.,For crying out loud couldn't you guys let you enthusiasm for the EU die after your Geo 2 oral?,It's become like a religion,this soceity should have just been called European School alumni - I would have been more inclined to join :p....,@Chris Kaye : "subvert democracy" might be a bit harsh but I agree that I don't really see the point in this society, I suspect it is somewhat of an old boys club of ex-European school students. Why don't you guys channel your school hang up into more proactive ventures like Facebook stalking and flirting with you old History teacher? Piccinin has become so hot since he's opted for an Indiana Jones lifestyle.

People always discuss the European Union as though it were some mysterious and distant institution that has either too much, or too little power depending on the point of view. The current financial crisis has stepped up the discussions about the EU and here in the UK, the EU has become a hot topic in the last few months. However it seems that it is more and more difficult to follow all the changes currently affecting European policies.

The Imperial College European Society was created to provide a platform for Imperial students interested in joining the debate about the EU andto provide information to those that are curious about how this very large institution works.

We will organise debates to which every single student will be welcome to participate. We are very excited about hearing the opinions of as many people as possible and for this reason all our events and membership will be free

Our members will have the amazing opportunity to attend our workshops and talks where we will have EU officials, MEPs and high profile EU experts as speakers. We are open to all the students of Imperial College, regardless of their level of knowledge on EU issues as we are here to inform and increase awareness starting from the very basics of the European Union.

Our society is connected to a broad network of Londonbased organizations that debate about the EU. This connection will help us to get connected to high profile speakers.

To stay updated, keep an eye on the Politics section where we will be writing articles commenting on the biggest EU news. One of our first articles will be about the burning issue of the UK-EU relationship. As it was made clear by the Prime Minister in his recent speech, the government will hold a referendum if the conservatives are re-elected. The result of this referendum will have crucial consequences on the future career and lives of all current Imperial Students. We want to provide you with the information necessary to cast an educated vote if this referendum is to happen.

There is of course more to come and we welcome all of you to share your thoughts with us. In our Facebook page we post news, hold discussions and communicate with our members, so join us! We are looking forwards to hear your opinions and arguments.
