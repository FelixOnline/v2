In 2009, I received a copy of Tru Thoughts’ Tenth Anniversary album and although I was slightly embarrassed at the fact that it took me ten years to notice them, it was musically one of the best things that’s ever happened to me.

Tru Thoughts is a gem of a label, nestled down in Brighton on the south coast. In just over a decade they’ve established themselves as one of the leading independent record labels in the UK. Founders Robert Luis and Paul Jonas have always had a keen ear for talented artists who mix styles from jazz and soul, to house and techno, to calypso and salsa.

Next Saturday, Tru Thoughts are taking over KOKO and bringing with them the finest artists on their roster. The globe-trotting record store-fiend Quantic will be DJiing (expect records that God himself doesn’t know exist...) and Nostalgia 77 and Belleruche will also be gracing the stage. If all that doesn’t persuade you, Robert Luis has made a special mix-cd for the night and is giving it away free on the night. See you there!
