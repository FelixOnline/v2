A debate about Britain’s place in the EU is due to take place at Imperial on the 2nd of June. Representatives from both camps will be there to argue over whether we should vote to leave the EU on the 23rd of June.

Speaking for remain is Amelia Womack, the deputy leader of the Green party. An Imperial alumnus, Womack stood for the Greens in several constituencies before being voted deputy leader, making her the youngest of any political party.

Unusually, the advocate for leave is a staunch socialist: the writer and journalist, Tariq Ali. He was born in Pakistan and became politically active in his teenage years before studying PPE at Oxford. He now contributes to the Guardian and the London Review of Books. He’s written several books, including Bush in Babylon, criticising the 2003 invasion of Iraq through the media of poetry and essays.

The event is being organised by ICU’s Left Forum, a new group that aims to hold events, campaigns and discussion on politics. The club is currently in the union’s ‘incubator’ period, on the way to becoming an official club. A successful EU debate is likely to work in their favour on the way to becoming an official ICU endorsed club.

The debate is on the 2nd of June in Skempton LT 164. Check the Facebook event for updates on speakers.
