On Monday Metric will be hosting the first ever Volunteer Awards, which promises to be an action-packed event definitely not to be missed. It will give everyone the chance to show their support by voting for the best volunteering projects while enjoying free cake (!) and also allow people to learn more about volunteering at Imperial. This is both the first formal recognition of volunteers at Imperial AND the first High Tea that Metric has ever seen. So prepare yourself for banging tunes and an awards ceremony next to which all others pale by comparison.

The Awards will start at 4pm â€“ what better to do on a Monday afternoon than come along to Metric for high tea!
