At 11:45 on Wednesday morning Luke Kanczes (above), the Royal College of Science Union (RCSU) President, mysteriously went missing. He was seen locked in a hockey storeroom and being paraded around the quad before disappearing into the dungeons of the East Basement. It is believed that a crack team of [Raising and Giving (RAG)](http://union.ic.ac.uk/rag/) members, or ‘RAG-gers’, carried this out, bagging and tying him up and quickly removing him from the premises before security could do anything about it.

RAG subsequently released a statement, reading: “Luke Kanczes, the RCSU president went missing at some point on Wednesday October 12. A ransom demand was madeand RCSU, unlike the medics, won’t try and steal him back at a later charity event.”

RCSU donated the profits from their [Autumn Ball](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/1501/rcsu-autumn-ball-a-hit-for-freshers/), – in excess of £200 – and the RCSU exec will put a team forward for LOST, an event where students are left in mysterious locations and have to hitchhike back to college, which will be held on November 5.

It is as yet unknown whether Kanczes has been freed from his predicament.
