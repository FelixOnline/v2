Many of you may have read the article written by the Hockey Club Captain last week referencing the email written to the Imperial 2s captain by the KCL 1s captain. The email undoubtedly showed unsportsmanlike behaviour on the part of the KCL captain but also gave the 2s even more motivation to go out there and show KCL exactly what they are made of.

The task ahead of the 2s was undoubtedly a daunting one. KCL 1s are 3 BUCs leagues above them, pushing for the LUSL Premier Division title and were coming off the back of a 4-0 victory over IC 1s, but therein lies the beauty of the cup. The chance for the underdogs to shine, pull off that great upset, win against all the odds and, above all else, enjoy playing the sport they love on a grand stage. Each and every player in the 2s team knew what the game meant. Win, and they had pulled off the biggest cup upset of the year so far, lose, and they could hold their heads up high and say they gave it their all.

The pre-match warm up was unfortunately non-existent due to a frozen pitch and late location change but the rousing pre-matchspeech delivered by injured captain Jimmy S was all the warm up the boys needed. With keeper Sifter still putting on his helmet and gloves, the umpires started the game. Instantly KCL 1s were on the attack and looking to put the game to bed early. Barely having adjusted his helmet, Sifter was called into action after some slack defending with a smart save at his near post. If the 2s didn’t know they were in for a tough match beforehand, they did now.

Undaunted by their slow start, the 2s got to work at what they do best. Simple yet effective passing moves began to unlock the KCL defence. Every player on the pitch was happy to receive the ball under pressure knowing that a teammate wasthere to receive the next pass. The 2s fluid style of play soon gave them their first opportunity. A quick free hit taken by B. Tablet at the back gave Fresher Alex space to run at the KCL defence. After skinning two players he pulled the ball back for the on rushing Tinkerbell, again playing in his unique position of creative centre back. A square ball found the ever reliable Strap-On on the left flank who delivered a peach of a ball into the KCL circle met by Fresher Tim, running at full pace, for a first time shot that was tipped over the cross bar.

With the KCL defence looking rattled, IC pushed on. Strikers Brickney and Fresher Jay-Zed were full of running upfront giving the KCL defenders a torrid time tracking them. Cummy B was creative as the attacking midfielder knowing that Old Man Mikey was behind him to mop up any loose ball that should come his way. However the KCL team still looked dangerous going forward and the IC defence had to be on their toes. What happened next was definitely not in the KCL script.

IC centre back, Soggy, decided he had had enough of marking his man (which he doesn’t like doing at the best of times) and stepped in front to cut out a dangerous through ball. He played a peach of a pass out wide to Meat Spin who played a deft one-twowith Y.Bag before winning a penalty corner. Cummy B received the ball at the top of the circle, drew two defenders before playing an under arm pass to Fresher Tim who smashed the ball home into the far corner of the goal. The IC players went mad celebrating and, still buzzing from their moment of glory, nearly allowed KCL to hit straight back.

Poor defending allowed the KCL striker a free shot from less than 6 yards. Goalie, Sifter, rushed out to smother the initial shot before jumping back to his feet and diving right to keep out the rebound. Two further rebounds followed with the first being blocked by the keepers out stretched stick and the latter beaten away by his outstretched hand. The ball eventually found its way to a KCL player no more than 3 yards from an open goal only for him to inexplicably play the ball millimetres wide of the post. This was the shock to the system that IC needed and they stepped up their game to see off the rest of the half with no major scares.

At the start of the second half, KCL cameout with a renewed vigour. They pushed forwards looking for the equaliser and no more than 5 minutes into the second half they nearly had it. Slick play down the right hand side say a cross whipped in leaving an unmarked player to slot the ball home. However, IC protested that the ball had come off the player’s foot but with the umpire unsighted he was unable to make a call. Then followed a display of sportsmanship not previously shown by KCL; when questioned by the umpire, the KCL striker admitted that he had kicked the ball in. That was the second let off for IC and they were determined that they wouldn’t need a third.

Hitting KCL on the counter attack from a short corner that was magnificently blocked by Soggy, IC won a short corner of their own. The corner routine broke down but the ball eventually found its way to Y.Bag who played a dangerous ball in that was deflected in by a KCL defender. Not wanting to sit on their two goal lead, IC grew in confidence and began to push KCl deeper and deeper into their own half. Several chances fell to IC players with Strap-On one of many players guilty of poor finishing.

KCL had put 3 past the IC 1s in the last 10 minutes of the game the previous week and so IC knew the threat that they still posed. KCL decided to have one last roll of the dice and pushed men forwards. A rocket of a ball was played straight through the heart of the IC defence only for the IC keeper to once again be on hand to make a double save. KCL’s frustration began to tell and, after numerous offences, they went down to ten men after a player was sent off for repeated stick tackles. This spelt the end of any threat they still posed to the IC clean sheet.

At the final whistle the IC players were elated at avenging the IC 1s loss; the KCL team were shell shocked by their 2-0 defeat. The biggest cup upset ofthe year so far had just occurred, I say so far as IC 2s face UCL 1s in the quarter finals next term. So to echo the words of the ICHC Club Captain, whether it be in the league or the cup, just remember, the bigger they are, the harder they fall.
