My favourite line in this song is: "We got food everywhere as if the party was catered." If there is so much food (high-quality no doubt) at the party, such that the impression is given that someone has hired a catering company, but in fact it's not catered, then where the hell is all the food from? Did R Kelly just head down to [Walmart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1tufujnbzU) or something?
