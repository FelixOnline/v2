As reported extensively by the media [this week](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/1607/university-applications-fall-by-9/), university applications have seen an approximate drop of 9% from last year. In the wake of such a startling figure (especially in comparison to the year-on-year rise that the sector has recently enjoyed), questions must be asked regarding the potential implications that this may have on Imperial College.

The answer to such questions is relatively simple however. The decrease in applications that we have seen will have primarily little effect on the College â€“ as long as Imperial continues to publicise how exactly it can help (primarily UK-based) students from deterring.

Schemes are already being implemented to ensure that students will continue to apply to Imperial, such as the new and more extensive [bursary scheme](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/1089/details-of-new-bursary-scheme-emerge/).

However, an overwhelmingly negative perception still exists for many across the country with regards to tuition fees in general. Despite widespread advice from governmental bodies urging prospective students not to be dissuaded from applying to university by the rise in tuition fees, there still exists a distinct thought in the minds of those considering higher education as a real option.

This thought, whether held by friends or family, is that students will be loaded with a staggeringly large student loan to pay back following graduation. This negativity follows from a generation that received higher education for next to no cost.

It is this perception that Imperial must tackle if it is to retain its impressive application rates. The bursary scheme must be publicised in the coming weeks as prospective students continue to consider their path for the future. Focus need not be primarily focused on bursaries, however. The fact that contributions from alumni continue to enable students to embark on their studies here is a fact that should be promoted as widely as possible.

Nevertheless, it is also worth remembering the rise in applications from overseas. Imperial is sure to continue encouraging international students to apply, ensuring no real danger from reduced demand. We must also consider the fact that applications for science based courses has seen a lower percentage drop in comparison with other subjects.

Including international students, Imperial is probably one of the safest universities in light of the announcements. We should not expect campus to become a ghost town overnight. We should only start getting worried once the Union is empty on a Wednesday night.
