Hey guys! I am Laura Chen, the 18-19 International Officer. My role is to represent the international student body and to advocate for cultural diversity at Imperial College.

Imperial is a truly global community with 64% of its students being non-UK students and from all over the world. To engage the students and to celebrate diversity on campus, I have formed an International Committee to organise the very first International Week at Imperial. The five of us have worked with varies student bodies / organisations to bring you a range of events from 11th to 15th March. Other than the events, we have placed an interactive world map in the library and flags around campus to create an “international vibe”. We hope you have enjoyed the week!

Organising the very first International Week wasn’t easy, we have faced numerous problems and unexpected issues; and there is so much room for improvement. However, I sincerely hope that the week can become a tradition at Imperial, to remind all of us how lucky we are living in such a diverse and global community!

Lastly, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch. My email is: intstude@ic.ac.uk.
