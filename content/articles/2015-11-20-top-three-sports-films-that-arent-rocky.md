People always say the original _Rocky_ is a classic, but I’ve never really seen this. I challenge its fans to watch it again today, and tell me it’s aged well. Yes, there are some iconic scenes, but this is not because they’re good – rather it’s because the film was popular. What we have here is a serious case of nostalgia goggles. Here are some alternatives:

___Raging Bull_____ (1980)__

The _better_ film about an Italian-American underdog boxer, Raging Bull is _Rocky_ without the melodrama. Scorsese replaces Avildsen, and De Niro – in his best role bar The Godfather 2 – replaces Stallone. It’s a bit like that scene in Shaun of the Dead where the cast meet their superior alternate versions. _Raging Bull_ isn’t an easy watch but there’s a reason people have written whole books about it.

___The Wrestler_____ (2008)__

Another film I could write about for years, _The Wrestler_ is one of Darren Aronofsky‘s best films. The backstory here is interesting enough, with Mickey Rourke making a return to cinema after huge issues with drugs and plastic surgery. His story is reflected in that of the main character Randy “The Ram” Robinson, whose tale is one of a washed-out ex-wrestler and his attempts to reconnect with his daughter whilst resisting the lure of a comeback.

___Space Jam_____ (1996)__

_Space Jam_ may not be a work of cinematic mastery like _Raging Bull_ or _The Wrestler_ but damn it’s still an amazing film. The ridiculous pairing of Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes is one only the greediest and most brilliant of film companies could think up. More intelligent than one would think, the film is genuinely funny in parts. The question is, does me liking this film for mostly nostalgic reasons make me a hypocrite considering my thoughts on _Rocky_? A little bit, but to be fair _Space Jam_’s theme song is way better.
