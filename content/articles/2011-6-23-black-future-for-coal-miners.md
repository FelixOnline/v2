Decades after pit closures that claimed 170,000 jobs across England, coalfield communities continue to suffer from chronic arthritis, asthma and long-term back problems.

Researchers at Durham University found that people living in coalfield areas were [27 per cent more likely to suffer from a limiting long-term illness](http://www.dur.ac.uk/somuchmore/regional_news/?itemno=12059). The results suggest that more government assistance and focus is required if coalmining communities are to be given a chance at regeneration and improved health.

According to the findings, regeneration efforts in some less-deprived coalfield communities have helped improve health and economic stability, but poorer areas have found it more difficult to bounce back. These communities may have to rely on government initiatives to tackle inequalities with wealthier areas.

One such initiative, the [Coalfields Regeneration Trust](http://www.coalfields-regen.org.uk/) (CRT), has pledged £30 million to help coalfield areas overcome health and skills inequalities, achieve economic growth, and become self-sustaining communities. Andy Lock, Assistant Director at Coalfields Regeneration Trust said: “We know that health problems are still very severe in some places and our challenge from Government is to continue to address health inequalities. Our success is built on working collaboratively with communities and to support their responses to local health needs.”

The pit closures between 1984 and 1997 left coalfield areas environmentally degraded and in poor economic condition. Many were isolated in rural areas, with poor infrastructure and little opportunity for commercial growth or tourism. The effects of these closures are still being felt in England’s poorest areas, leading to long-term medical conditions and widespread unemployment.
