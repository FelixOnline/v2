Do you ever wonder why we are here? Does it make sense that everything around us has a purposeful order to it and we are the anomalies? Will our lives ever matter in the grand scheme of things, or are we just material beings, that can feel pleasure because of chemicals in the brain? ‘Who’ is it that actually feels?

If these questions resonate with you, then it will be worth finding out the answers Islam gives. Discover Islam week will be taking place from the 24th-28th February. This week is your chance to find out about the fundamental questions pertaining to our existence, clear up any misconceptions, and indulge in lots of exotic foods for free.

Throughout the week there will be exhibitions in Sherfield and SAF on Islam and approachable volunteers at hand to discuss and clarify any questions you have. Speakers from all around the world will be travelling to Imperial to give exciting talks, which will undoubtedly provide a platform for a myriad of intellectual discussions. The talks will kick off on Tuesday 29th with ‘The Pursuit of Happiness’ and on Thursday 27th the talk will discuss ‘Is Life Just a Game?’. The week will conclude on the Friday with an open Q&A ‘Discover over Dinner’ session, there will be two renowned guest speakers and of course, a free dinner with a mix of Indian and Arab cuisine! And it gets better – you can share your opinions and discuss these topics in length with a number of friendly volunteers.

“And we did not create the heavens and the earth and that between them in play.” Quran {44:38}

Islam is simple. It is a religion with over 1.6 billion followers (yes a staggering 25% of the population is Muslim) and 5000 Brits convert to Islam every year. We are here for a purpose and life is a journey where you fulfil that purpose. Our soul needs nourishment just the way our body does. Yet we spend our lives perfecting this material body, chasing material possessions, and not recognising the spiritual side to our beings. Perfection is not just inward, but outward in our actions and deeds. Islam asks us to dedicate our lives to the service of humanity, which in itself is an act of worship. Islam is a philosophy and religion and offers moral, economic, social and judicial systems for the betterment of the human condition. And Muhammad was not just a Prophet, but was revolutionary, a statesman, a negotiator, a military tactician, a spiritual guide, a husband, a father, lover and most importantly a human like you and me. Islam is a holistic way of life, not just a superficial doctrine.

Regardless of your perceptions, the only way to truly know for sure is to find out. We most humbly invite you to take part in Discover Islam Week; most assuredly, it will be a life changing opportunity not to be missed!
