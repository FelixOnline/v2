Dichotomy is the act of separating anything into two separate components, A and B. A great asset of this is to keep things simple, easy to manage, and reduce variables to a minimum.
 An example of this is “you’re either with me, or you’re against me”.

This dichotomy seems fairly straightforward (if a little intimidating). This statement intimidates and coerces up until the point that we realise that the dichotomy is in fact, false. The position of neutral ground is a perfectly logical one, which the statement avoids in order to carry through its effect.
 The use of false dichotomy is one that seems to constantly crop up in daily life, yet it is very infrequently noticed, forgotten as people make an exclusive decision and move on.

Many a time has a great opportunity been stymied by the inability of the decision makers to agree on a course of action because their personal preferences seemed mutually exclusive. Great nights out stalled, deals failed, relationships broken, or never even begun when often the perceived dichotomy was totally bogus.

Many false dichotomies seem to find their roots in people’s own beliefs and assumptions. Usually they are exacerbated when said people don’t question their beliefs critically and on a regular basis.
 To take another example: “A student must choose two of theses option at Imperial: social life, good grades, or sleep”. Daniel chose sleep.
