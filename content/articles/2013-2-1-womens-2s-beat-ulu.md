On Wednesday 30th January, Imperial Women’s 2nd Fencing Team set off to duel the University of London Union (ULU) team. The opposing team was an unknown quantity, causing Imperial to keep their guard up. The match began with Clare Perry, Hannah Bryars and Slavina Georgieva fencing sabre. Clare cut to the chase, beating her opponent 5-0. Slavina and Hannah continued, demonstrating that this was not a feint, leading to Imperial winning every round, only halting at 45-6.

After sabre, the women’s foil team, composed of Sara Chakera, Veronica Ilkow, and Hannah fought for victory, rapidly getting to the point, and allowing their opponents only 17 hits to 45. ULU were foiled again!

Epee followed, with Becky Razey, Cora Anna and Helen Pennington. ULU took offence at losing two weapons, and redoubled their efforts. Imperial fought to keep ULU under 62 hits (the Women’s 2nds previous record). The final score in Epee was 45-29, with Imperial having won every single round of every weapon. Imperial had lunged for victory, winning 135-52, leaving ULU piste off!
