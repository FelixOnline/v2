## ABC
The leading ladies of ABC certainly have lots of reasons to celebrate. Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) and her crisis management firm OPA will be back for a fourth season of ___Scandal___, country singers Rayna James (Connie Britton) and Juliette Barnes (Hayden Panettiere) of ___Nashville___ will sing for us once more in season three, Emily Thorne (Emily VanCamp) and Victoria Grayson (Madeleine Stowe) will return to battle it out once more in the deliciously trashy ___Revenge___, going into its fourth season now, Storybrooke and its residents, namely Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison), Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Regina (Lana Parrilla), have yet another magical curse to face off against, when ___Once Upon a Time___ returns for a fourth season, and going into its impressive eleventh season is Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and her merry band of horny doctors working in the wildly promiscuous work environment of Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital in ABC’s long-running hit, ___Grey’s Anatomy___.

Also renewed, is the high-rated sitcom ___Modern Family___ (not surprising, given it’s already won back-to-back best comedy series awards at the Emmys four years in a row), ___Resurrection___, ABC’s breakout freshman show that gave the network some decent numbers on Sundays, plus superhero drama ___Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.___, that didn’t turn out as amazing as people had originally hoped.

Bad news for some comedy shows that faced the axe, Rebel Wilson couldn’t quite work her magic on television with ___Super Fun Night___, whereas ___Trophy Wife___, ___Mixology___, ___Back in the Game ___were all booted off too. Soapy thriller ___Betrayal ___which hoped to gain some lead-in audience on Sundays from _Revenge_ never caught on, the awful ___Killer Women___ got canned after just six episodes posting terrible ratings,___ The Assets___, ___Mind Games___, and ___Lucky 7___ also faced the chop. _Once Upon a Time_’s spin-off show, ___Once Upon a Time in Wonderland___ is also missing out on a second season, though the show’s star Michael Socha is set to join the original show in its new season.
## ## CBS
Crime procedurals are still going as strong as ever over in CBS, with a long list of renewals for ___CSI___ (season 15!), ___NCIS ___(season 12!),___ Criminal Minds___ (season 10!), ___NCIS: Los Angeles___ (season 6) (in fact, the _NCIS_ series is so damn successful they’re doing another spin-off, ___NCIS: New Orleans___), ___Person of Interest___ (season 4), ___The Mentalist ___(season 7), ___Hawaii Five-0___ (season 5), ___Elementary ___(season 3), and ___Blue Bloods___ (season 5). ___The Good Wife___ is also getting a sixth season (hurrah!) which is no doubt the best news this network could have offered. CBS has certainly done incredibly well in its long-running shows, picking a fresh genre of episodic shows for its audience to enjoy.

Number 1 comedy ___The Big Bang Theory___ was renewed for not one, but three more seasons, because the show is really doing that well. Even without Charlie Sheen, there is no stopping ___Two and a Half Men___, as it would appear Ashton Kutcher is a good enough replacement for the controversial star. The show is going into its 12th season now. Freshman comedies ___Mom___, starring the excellent duo of Allison Janney and Anna Faris, and ___The Millers___ will return for sophomore seasons. Kat Dennings and Beth Behrs will keep up with their baking, as ___2 Broke Girls ___was renewed for a fourth season, with Melissa McCarthy and Billy Gardell returning as the plus-sized, adorable couple ___Mike & Molly___.

Cancelled is the good but uneven and ever-so slightly wordy and over-the-top ___The Crazy Ones___, which was led by the great Robin Williams, comedies___ Bad Teacher___ (based on the film of the same name), ___We Are Men___ and ___Friends with Better Lives___, along with thrillers ___Hostages___ (better left alone as a stand-alone season, so this cancellation is great news) and ___Intelligence___.
## ## the CW
Teen channel the CW has successfully tapped into what teenage girls like most these days: good looking dudes, the supernatural, and mainly, vampires. And so the shows the tick these boxes have given their worthy renewals. The Winchester brothers (Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki) will live to fight demons once again in ___Supernatural___’s tenth season, Salvatore vampire brothers Stefan (Paul Wesley) and Damon (Ian Somerhalder) will continue to pine for Elena’s (Nina Dobrev) affection in ___The Vampire Diaries___’ sixth season, the show’s spin-off ___The Originals___, focusing on “original vampires” (whatever the hell that means) is getting a second season, and a modern retelling of the story ___Beauty and the Beast___ will return in a reduced episode capacity (13, instead of the usual 20+), for what will presumably be the show’s final season.

Two freshman shows are set to return; the surprisingly good ___Reign___, a reimagined tale of Mary Queen of Scots, in which good-looking people breaking up has more consequences than merely broken hearts, as kingdoms and lives hang in the balance. ___The 100___, which tasks 100 juvenile delinquents to possibly repopulate Earth after a nuclear war destroyed the planet 97 years prior to the show’s events, is deservingly on the network’s renewal list.

Popular superhero Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) and his show ___Arrow ___is set for season 3, although the happy news could not be shared for Amell’s cousin, Robbie Amell, whose show ___The Tomorrow People___, which was arguably more interesting than ___Arrow___, was cancelled after just one season.

___Star-Crossed___, which tried too hard to be a clever analogy for modern society and politics, and then failed miserably, will not get a follow-up season, and the network’s spectacularly bad idea of adapting _Sex and the City_ as some sort of a prequel with ___The Carrie Diaries___, is finally getting the axe after two seasons.
## ## FOX
Not a huge batch of drama shows to marvel at. ___Sleepy Hollow___ will return for a second season, the network is refusing to put ___The Following___ out of its misery, giving the show an ill-advised third season (the Joe Carroll madness has gone on long enough), long-running procedural ___Bones___ will return for its tenth season, as will ___Glee, ___a show that is getting progressively worse, for its sixth and final (thank god) season.

FOX is known for its successes with its long-running animated shows. ___The Simpsons___ will be entering its astonishing season 26, whereas ___Family Guy___ is set to debut its thirteenth season in autumn 2014.

On the comedy front, the network has done better. Golden Globe winning cop comedy ___Brooklyn Nine-Nine___ has been renewed for a second season, Zooey Deschanel and her quirky sitcom ___New Girl___ is set to return for its fourth season, and Mindy Kalig, the hyperactive mess of an OBGYN who is entertaining to watch, will be back for ___The Mindy Project___ in its third season.

Not coming back for the next television year is the well-reviewed but under-watched military sitcom ___Enlisted ___which debuted at an awful Friday night slot, as well as the controversial ___Dads___ which was heavily criticised for its content. Greg Kinnear’s comedy vehicle ___Rake___ hit the lowest of the low viewing figures towards the end of its thirteen-episode run, which explains why FOX decided to dump it. Also canned are ___Surviving Jack ___and ___Raising Hope___ the latter of which had a good run (four seasons) and really showed off the comic potential of Garret Dillahunt and Martha Plimpton.
## ## NBC
Although posting some dismal numbers as of late, NBC certainly hit the jackpot with ___The Voice___, pairing the reality show on Monday nights with its excellent new drama, without doubt the best new series of the 2013/14 season, ___The Blacklist___, starring the formidable James Spader. Consistently delivering strong ratings, it came as no surprise when NBC decided to give this show a second season.

NBC is trying to recreate the franchise success of _Law & Order_ with its ___Chicago ___series and at the moment they have ___Chicago Fire___ and ___Chicago P.D.___ going into the third and second seasons respectively.

The darkly chilling, potent thriller ___Hannibal___ will be back for season 3, starring Mads Mikkelsen in the titular serial-killing cannibal role, with Hugh Dancy trying to lock him up. NBC’s answer to ABC’s _Once Upon a Time_, ___Grimm ___is returning for season 4. Comedy shows ___Parenthood___ and ___Parks and Recreation___ have both been renewed for their final seasons, so a tearful farewell to those excellent sitcoms.

A long list of shows getting cancelled over at NBC. Michael J. Fox’s return to television didn’t attract much audience with ___The Michael J. Fox Show___, nor was anyone really interested in Sean Hayes’ ___Sean Saves the World___, Jonathan Rhys Meyers’ comeback role as the title character in ___Dracula___ was met with lukewarm reception, and it would seem the name J. J. Abrams is no longer working its magic on the television screen, as ___Revolution___ and ___Believe___, both executive produced by Abrams, were given the axe. ___Crisis___, an absurd thriller starring Dermot Mulroney and Gillian Anderson has also been cut.
