Last Saturday saw the return of Felix Music Night for their final party of the year and boy, was it a party. Things were kicked off with an uplifting jazz & bass set from __Phrij__. Accompanying his selection, __Gabor Kerekes__ shone the hypnotic motion of oils, colours and washing up liquid swirling through each other through an old-school over-head projector.

This was followed by wonderful jazz musicianship of disco funk outfit __Spank Alley__, the brash and crass noise rock of trio __Nipples__ and the usual glorious insanity of __Operation Midnight Climax__.

With the line-up thus far reading like a night at a rather sordid bar, the first representatives from the label headliners, XVI Records, stepped up. __Evermean__, DJ and MC, tore the place up playing the best in Londonâ€™s recent bass and garage music surge. Running a bit behind schedule, the headline act for the night stepped up, flown in from Luxembourg for one night only: __Sunglitters__. He took things down a notch with his beautiful, blissed-out and soulful electronica, weaving r&b samples through dizzying electronics. However the crowd began to itch for something to make them bounce and with that, up stepped __My Panda Shall Fly__ who proceeded to play a rip-roaring garage set, even including a little __Craig David__.

The night was a huge amount of fun, with most people leaving more than a little sweaty. The perfect sign-off for the Felix Music Nights this year.
