A mysterious stranger was caught wandering Tizard last Sunday. The man was described as tall with dark skin and badly dressed. He was wearing a red jacket and was noted to be carrying a Bible and had an American accent.

The intruder was escorted from the premises by hall security and the Tizard warden. There has been no further information about who the man was and his purpose in entering the halls.

The Falmouth and Keogh Hall wardens are re-emphasising the importance of stopping people from tailgating, a very common occurrence in halls. They have said that residents should never let anyone they do not know into the building. If residents come across someone who refuses to swipe in or does not have an ID card than that person would be reported.

They have also reiterated that swiping into both the hall itself and the main entrance is very important for security records. This is so they can keep a record of who is going in and out of the halls and is useful for if someone cannot be located for a number of days.

_Itâ€™s especially prudent to pay attention to security risks at the start of term - Ed._
