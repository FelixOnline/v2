In our last home game of the regular season, the Immortals faced the Kingston Cougars. After an amazing performance against the Lions last Sunday, the team was confident coming into the game. However, after a long and hard-fought game, the final score was 12-20 to the Cougars.

Early on in the game, the defensive team were moving around, causing a lot of havoc on Kingston’s offense. Multiple penalties were called, particularly false starts from the Cougar’s offensive side. As a result, the line of scrimmage was continuously moved up field, closer and closer to the end zone. Finally, the defense were able to force a punt, opening up the flood-gates for the offensive team. With an extremely impressive drive, Quarterback, Kevin Kimono, rushed into the end zone getting the first touchdown of the day (2-point conversion was unsuccessful). With a tiring and injury-filled defense, multiple offensive linemen filled in on defense and held the Cougars into the half with a score of 6-7.

In the second half, a frustrated Cougars side adapted to our vocal defense by introducing clap snaps in the hopes of reducing penalties going against them. This failed to stop Sam ‘No Chill’ Hill laying a filthy sack on the quarterback and Alex ‘heads down’ Brockhurst laying him out in another play. Well done Alex!

On the other hand, running back Papa Noach Ben-Haim made some very impressive runs gaining a lot of yards, however, a fumble resulted in a turnover and ultimately a touchdown by the Cougar’s quarterback (kick was good), making the score 6-14. The offense came back strong however, with multiple impressive run plays and the famous rolling maul, ending the third quarter deep inside Cougar territory. After a few plays, Josemi Idigoras completed his first reception and touchdown for the Immortals (two point conversion was unsuccessful), hopefully with many more to come for him! After a late touchdown from the Cougars, the game ended with a score of 12-20, unfortunately meaning that the Immortals are now officially relegated from the Premiership league, however, this also gives the team a chance to rebuild and come back strong. This game’s MVPs were: Sam Hill – for performing tremendously both ways, laying down tackles left, right, and centre; Markus Mohr – again for performing very well both ways; Harry Lawrence – covering well, making essential plays to stop passes; Race Koidan – for being a good laugh, a good lad, and an even more impressive versatile player; and David Rovick – for playing in a position he’s never been in before and performing well.
