__I should start off by saying that I loved the book – you’ve converted me to Science Fiction! __

Fantastic! You weren’t a sci-fi fan before then?

__No, and I was nervous about reading it in case I thought it was awful!__

Lots of people have felt the same way –I’ve had some fantastic feedback from people though – it’s really lovely to hear people say that they’re not normally science fiction fans and yet the absolutely loved the book. That’s something I really wanted to achieve.

__How did you come up with the idea of ‘The Looking Glass Club’?__

I’m not still a physicist but I do like to read about it, about new ideas and became so engaged in it that I actually thought about writing a book about physics itself; then I realised that that probably wasn’t going to happen and it would take about ten years of dedication and incredible mathematical rigour so I thought I would do the next best thing and make a novel instead. I had a dream actually – It was one of those moments where you just run out of bed and get right to the keyboard and start writing.

__What made you decide to set part of the novel at Imperial?__

That was a very conscious decision because I get a bit sick of reading novels set in Cambridge colleges and I just thought ‘But Imperial’s great!’ and it deserves to be on the fictional map. I’m very proud of Imperial – I’ve spent six years of my life there and I just fell in love with London and Imperial the moment I arrived.

__Was it difficult to find a publisher for a Science Fiction book?__

Yup, it’s an incredibly tough market because it’s so niche – in fact there are only six publishers for it in the UK. I think part of the reason for that is because most of it is rubbish! I find that as a scientist it’s very frustrating to read a badly written SF book with fundamental principles so badly written and sometimes even wrong and you just think ‘God, why are they even bothering?’

__There’s so many ideas and theories about physics, philosophy and technology in the book – were you ever told to ‘dumb it down’?__

Yes! Absolutely! I had a meeting with an agent and her assistant editor and because she’d been so enthusiastic about it I sort of expected that I’d been going in the right direction. Her assistant editor didn’t have the same views though – he didn’t really like the science and didn’t like the fact that it was so technical and he basically said ‘you can’t do this, it’s not your job to write a book about physics or philosophy – it’s your job to write about guns and car chases.’ At that point I just thought ‘well, you’re an idiot – don’t tell me what to write!’

__Any tips for budding authors? __

Yes! Don’t go it alone – get involved with an authors group. I found a great group online which was a great form of support as it is quite a lonely endeavour, and writing a novel is hard!
