Here we are at the end of the first proper week and here’s a new spread of science to educate and hopefully entertain you. Philippa introduced me as a ‘bubbling biologist’ last week, which is an exaggeration, but true to form this week’s news story that has struck me is a biological one.

I strongly dislike common wasps. So it’s not difficult to understand that the concept of gigantic, venomous, aggressive wasps that can kill you make me glad that I live in Britain. Inhabit a place where a species whose queens can grow to be over 5cm long? No thanks.

Despite this, reports that hornets are responsible for over 40 deaths and at least 1600 injuries in the Chinese province of Shaanxi this summer have me weirdly enthralled. Hornet attacks are a fact of life in the area, but this year’s attacks are unprecedented in number and severity. It’s not hard to find photographs of unfortunate victims on the Internet. Their wounds look like small necrotic bullet holes.

Deaths are being attributed to both the Asian giant hornet and the Asian predatory wasp. The Asian giant hornet’s sting is the most venomous wasp sting known. The venom is capable of destroying red blood cells and thus causing kidney failure and death. Even if one hasn’t received a fatal dose of venom many suffer an allergic response and may die of anaphylaxis. The Asian predatory wasp is smaller but incredibly aggressive – people have described being chased for hundreds of metres by swarms of these hornets.

There is a lot of blame going around regarding the high number of attacks. The authorities have pointed to a prolonged period of dry and warm weather that has allowed hornet colonies to thrive. Environmentalists blame urbanisation of habitat where hornets build their nests. Others have cited additional ecological factors like a reduction in the numbers of hornets’ natural enemies.

The combination of these issues has surely led to the situation the Chinese people find themselves in this year. Unfortunately it cannot be fixed peacefully. Hornets have their numbers and their venom. Humans have hospitals and flamethrowers.

Who will win? Well, in the end humans always win. As a biologist that saddens me. Yet I can’t help it; the instinctive and selfish part of me looks at an Asian giant hornet and thinks, “Good riddance.”
