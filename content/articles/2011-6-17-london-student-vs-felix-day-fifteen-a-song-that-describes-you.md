There's always going to be something pretentious about choosing a song that 'describes' you, but the line "I just want to worry about those sunshine girls" sums up my outlook whenever I'm feeling [a little unmotivated](https://twitter.com/#!/kadhimshubber/status/65502287455457281) about doing Felix.
