Improving management education is the focus of a new alliance between [Imperial College Business School](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/business-school) and the [Hero Group in India](http://www.heromotors.com/). The Business school at Imperial will assist BML Munjal University (BMU) in India, to develop its School of Management. The Business School will act as a mentor institution; helping BMU to form, develop and grow its School of Management. The collaboration will focus on both research and education activities. BMU will open to students in July 2014.

Professor [Dorothy Griffiths](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/d.griffiths), Principal of the Business School, said: “India is one of the fastest growing economies and this is a great opportunity for the Business School to be at the heart of this exciting story. Our partnership with BMU will benefit our students, who can take advantage of the opportunity to study and learn in a fast paced and evolving environment, further increasing their expertise and experience. We look forward to exchanging ideas, students and knowledge with BMU.”

The agreement was signed on 9 January 2013 in New Delhi. It was attended by representatives of Imperial College London, this includes the President & Rector, Sir [Keith O’Nions](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/k.onions); Professor [Gerard George](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/g.george), the Deputy Principal for Faculty and Programmes at the Business School, and Director of the Rajiv Gandhi centre. Notable guests also joined them, including the Indian Education Minister Mr [Pallam Raju](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallam_Raju), Minister of Law[ Mr Ashwani Kumar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashwani_Kumar), Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission of the Republic of India [Mr Montek Singh Ahluwalia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montek_Singh_Ahluwalia), and the Chief Minister of Haryana Mr [Bhupinder Singh Hooda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhupinder_Singh_Hooda).

BMU aims to create a talented community of students that excel in teaching, learning and research; the major focus will be on technological advancement and socio-economic development. The Business School was chosen by BMU to participate in this alliance due to its expertise in innovation and entrepreneurship. Likewise, the Hero Group has over 50 years of successful business operations, with revenues of over $8 bn. They are one of the most respected business houses in India and have a world leadership position in many of their businesses.

The relationship includes the designing of teaching programmes and the development of the curriculum; as well as student exchange and summer programmes, joint research projects, faculty exchange and executive education. Professor Gerry George commented: “We are starting from scratch to create the Business School as part of a global university with a focus on research and teaching excellence. Not only does it allow the Business School to play a vital role in shaping the next generation of leaders in India, it creates a platform for collaboration and immersion for our students and our faculty. It is a window of opportunity for us to learn from India just as much as they learn from our experience and expertise.”
