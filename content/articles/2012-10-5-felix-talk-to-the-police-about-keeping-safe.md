Tim Arbabzadah: What basic advice would you give to freshers in halls?
 Nigel Lewis: Don’t keep large amounts of cash in your rooms, make sure your bedroom door is closed behind you and never allow someone to tailgate you.

 TA: How about the freshers not in halls?
 NL: If you intend to rent a property and haven’t already done so, stay clear of renting from the Gumtree website, try to keep to an approved estate agent. Remember – you get the keys at the same time as paying your deposit – not at a later date.

 TA: Given that laptops/iPads are so easy to carry, and so common: what can people do to make sure thieves don’t take things?
 NL: Any piece of electronic equipment can be registered at www.Imobilise.com – it is FREE!! If your items are stolen there is a much higher chance of getting them back if the police can trace them to you. As you move keep the information updated on the Imobilise website.
 Never leave your phone or laptop unattended anywhere in the college - particularly in the library. Not all the people you see in the college are students or staff.

 TA: When around campus, such as in the library, what should people do to keep possessions safe?
 NL: Take them with you – never leave them unattended.

 TA: What is the most common way that people lose and get stuff stolen?
 NL: Most theft in the college is due to folks not realising that it is a public place and that members of the public are often wandering around it. Students and staff leave their property unattended because they feel it is a safe place to do so. Leaving your laptop and phone in an unlocked office is like leaving it in Hyde Park or in a café.
 TA: When on nights out, what should everyone do to ensure nobody is harmed?
 NL: Always plan your journey home, few people do this and can end up a bit worse for drink and wandering around. If the night changes, re-assess your journey home. Try to stay with at least one other person and if you are travelling by bus, stay on the ground floor – don’t go upstairs.
 If someone offers you a “Cab” or “Taxi”, they are an illegal taxi tout. NEVER USE THE SERVICES OF AN ILLEGAL TAXI TOUT, you are just getting in to a stranger’s car, they can charge you what they like, would not have insurance to carry you, and could attack you.

 TA: Living out is the first difference between first and second year. What should people avoid doing?
 NL: Plan your journeys, ensure you pick up your post as soon as you can if it is left in a common area such as the hallway. Keep your room or apartment locked and never let a stranger in through the front door of the property. Don’t carry large sums of cash around, keep it in the bank.

TA: Landlord problems are not too uncommon. What should people do to make sure they aren’t taken to court and have a strong case if ever in trouble?
 NL: The Landlords and Tenants Act is very precise about the way a tenant and a landlord should conduct business and behave. When you take a property be sure to get a Shorthold Tenancy Agreement from your landlord. This will normally be for a period of 6 or 12 months. Pay the rent on time and keep the noise down.
 The police can’t help with landlord problems as it is a civil matter – but I am very happy to offer advice to students experiencing landlord problems, and at times can speak with the landlord to offer advice. You can contact me at Police@Imperial.ac.uk.

 TA: Drugs are something that people may encounter at university. Obviously, your advice is going to be to avoid drugs. For those who are going to, what should they do to make sure nobody gets hurt?
 NL: When in a club and drinking from a bottle, keep the bottle in your sight at all times so it can’t be spiked. The police would never advocate the use of illegal drugs because we so often see the consequences of drug use and the devastation it can cause.
 Never share needles, if you have to use drugs try not to drink alcohol at the same time, the effects can be devastating.
 The simple answer from me is always going to be: if you are arrested for a drug offence, your career may well be over, as may be your time at Imperial College. Keep a straight head and if you feel that you are having problems staying focused for your studies – go and get help from the excellent counsellors at Imperial.

 Nigel Lewis is the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) Liaison Officer for the police and runs an LGBT surgery at Imperial College. He is happy to speak to anyone regarding hate crime and LGBT issues.
