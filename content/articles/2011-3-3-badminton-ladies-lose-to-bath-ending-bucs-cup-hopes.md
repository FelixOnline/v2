We arrived in Bath to lovely sunshine and the picturesque view the city is famous for.

We didn’t have much time to enjoy the scenery before we had to head to the enormous sports village that Bath Universtiy have. When you get assigned your own changing room and enter a sports hall with a sign saying “High Performance Badminton Facility”, you do feel a bit of pressure not to embarrass yourself. And, although we lost 6-2 in the end, I do think we gave it a good shot.

Bath’s two doubles pairs were both of a similar, very solid standard and were probably helped by the fact that their coach gave them useful tactical tips in between sets.

Unfortunately, we didn’t manage to win any of the doubles games, but they were all enjoyable and on average we only lost each set by a respectible score of 21-15.

Our second singles competitor didn’t manage to win her games but it was a very impressive performance considering it was only her second singles match for us this season.

As usual, our first singles player saved us from losing and won both of her games, which prompted Bath’s coach to try and poach her to do a Master’s there (hands off, she only loves us!)

When we left the sports hall, feeling like we tried hard, we saw a sign on the wall saying: “Whoever said there is no difference between winning and losing, probably lost.”

That’s all well and good Bath, but at least we’ll be leaving university with an Imperial degree.
