The marketing campaign for the latest reboot/revival of the _Terminator_ series continues rolling, with a new batch of character posters hitting the web this week.

Posters for _Terminator Genisys_* have arrived, featuring looks at Arnold Schwarzenegger returning to one of the roles that made him famous, as well as Emilia Clarke’s take on Sarah Connor (originally played by Linda Hamilton).

There are also posters for John Connor (now played by Jason Clarke) and Kyle Reese (Jai Courtenay), leaders of the human resistance in 2029 as well, with one proving potentially more spoiler-ific than the other.

The spoiler-ridden posters are typical of the whole campaign for _Genisys_, truth be told, with the two trailers for the film (so far) already managing to reveal the majority of the film’s plot.

Several potentially big plot surprises are already common knowledge (but won’t be spoiled here).

The film initially follows the plot of the original _Terminator_ film (as written and directed by James Cameron), with John Connor sending Reese back in time to 1984 to prevent Skynet’s eponymous Terminator from murdering Sarah Connor.

From there, it all goes off the rails, as Reese finds himself in an alternate timeline where Connor was orphaned by a Terminator, and has been raised by a very familiar cyborg in her parents’ place.

Directed by Alan Taylor (of _Game of Thrones_ and _Thor: The Dark World_), and also starring the likes of Matt Smith (_Doctor Who_, obviously), _Terminator Genisys_ is due to ruin spelling across the UK from July 3.
