__IC Men’s 2s__ – 1
__Imperial Medics 2s__ – 1

The second encounter between IC Hockey Men’s 2s versus their Medic counterparts was always going to be an exciting fixture and it did not disappoint. Off the back of a mediocre performance in deepest, darkest and dirtiest Portsmouth last Wednesday, we were completely ready to spring back to winning ways.

A completely new-look Medic side from the one we played last term, along with several ringers from their 1st XI intrigued us somewhat as the Medics 2nd XI have failed to win any of their games this season and languish at the bottom of our BUCS league.

The match started with a flourish. Some excellent passing littered the first portion of the first half, with the seemingly frequent distribution channel of B. Man Briggs, Boris, Meatspin, Soggy Biscuit, GTG and Strap-on completely ripping apart the Medic midfield. The preliminary symptoms of an impending defeat obviously didn’t settle well with our Medic friends and they fought back with a couple of crafty attacks down both flanks. If it wasn’t for the heroics and diving tackles of B. Man Briggs at right back it may well have been first blood to the Medics.

Halfway through the first half came the breakthrough for IC. A scuffed undercut was plucked by a Medic midfielder above shoulder height and this led to the umpire giving a free hit to us. While the Medics were protesting against the decision, the quick thinking of Fresher Ed to self-pass and set up a breakaway attack paid dividends, with a lovely through-ball to Captain Slow who swept the ball into the goal for IC.

Needless to say, the Medics were furious at what they saw as an unfair advantage gained after the self pass. After a prolonged consultation between the umpires it was decided the goal should stand, prompting one of the Medics to agriculturally hurl his stick in anger about thirty feet. Ironically, C. Bell decided to ask the umpire to send him off which didn’t happen.

It reached half time with the score at 1-0, and some choice words from B. Man Briggs such as “no more beef” were taken on board by certain members of the team.

Once the second half got underway it became increasingly clear that the Medics’ keeper and defenders were actually in a league of their own. There were possibly five or six opportunities where we could have scored from close range, having either rounded the last defender or the goalkeeper, only to have our shot blocked by the last man’s stick on the goal line. It was clear that we were going to need more than just hitting the ball in the general direction of the goal to succeed in securing the win in this match.

Unfortunately halfway through the second half the Medics prevailed in getting an equalizer. A mixup in central midfield as to which players they were marking led to a 4 on 3 overload in our 22, leading the Medics to sail the ball past Glory Hole’s outstretched left hand from the top of the circle.

The rest of the game saw both sides push for the win. Some last ditch defending by the stirling back four ensured that the Medics stayed out. Unfortunately our short corner routines were once again woeful, something that should be changed. The indecisiveness of the short corner striker led to the Medics poaching the ball from unnecessarily on multiple occasions, and this led to many of our chances simply squandered.

With the final score 1-1, it was probably a fair result for both teams. However, with IC Mens’ 2s having the only team to not have won or drawn their Varsity Match at least once in the last two years, the hunger to conquer on the 21st March is now stronger than ever.
