In a tweet that would probably enrage most Imperial students, Allen’s response to the Education Minister asked the same question school children have been asking for years. She’s right that a lot of people are unlikely to ever use  the maths or science they learnt at school in real life, but the same could be said for P.E. I haven’t got off my fat arse and  done any real physical exercise for years.

Kanye randomly spurted out this turd on Twitter on Tuesday. Kim, please take his phone away. I’m a fan of Kanye’s work but he really needs someone to help him filter his thoughts (especially after his praise of Ben Carson last year). I have now thrown away my favourite Kanye t-shirt. I don’t want to be seen as promoting someone problematic in any way.
