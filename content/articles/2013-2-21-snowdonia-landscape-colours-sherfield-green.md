With each passing year, the Artsfest annual exhibition increases in importance. This show is the result of a collaboration between two of the largest arts societies on campus: Leonardo Fine Arts society and Photographic society. Last week, Rocio Molina gave us an insight into the trials and tribulations of putting on an exhibition. What was the outcome?

Slightly woozy on free white wine that tasted fruity and delicious and went down like grape juice – it should become common knowledge to the average student that so-called ‘private’ views are always alcoholically provided for – my eyes can perhaps be forgiven for initially only managing to focus on the great expanses of white wall that remained free of art. The Blythe gallery being a fine small space, eventually coming upon the collaborative piece was not quite unlike hunting for green fields in Antarctica; the landscape certainly popped up out of the lightness.

Whilst the exhibition can seem a bit sparse, it is also quite a feat of bravery and rather weirdly charming in a way that only unpolished things can manage to be.

The piece itself is a photograph – taken on the Photosoc trip to Snowdonia – deconstructed into square segments, some of which have been taken over by artists from Leosoc. Each of the contributors has a unique style and it is this that makes the piece most interesting to the viewer. From mad purple and jade colouring of the fields to well-realised landscapes in an Impressionist style, seeing the different approaches to the same romantic scenery are a wonderful way of looking, figuratively, through the eyes of many people.
