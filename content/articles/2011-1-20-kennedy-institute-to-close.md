The [Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology](http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/divisions/kennedy/), one of the world’s leading research centres in rheumatology, currently housed within the Faculty of Medicine of Imperial College will be relocated to Oxford University in what Felix has been told is a sensitive matter for the Faculty.

In November last year, an announcement was made detailing the collaboration between Oxford University and the Kennedy Institute Trust. The construction of a new rheumatology research centre at Oxford means that the sizeable grants awarded to Imperial through the Kennedy Institute will no longer be available.

A spokesperson for Imperial College London reassured Felix that no jobs were at risk.

Professor Sir Marc Feldmann, the current director of the Kennedy Institute at Imperial, told Felix that the move had been known about for approximately 2 years but declined to comment further.

A spokesman for Arthritis Research UK, one of the main funders of the Kennedy Institute stated that this wasn’t the first move for the Kennedy Institute and that it wasn’t unusual for research grants to move as they develop. They insisted that they have a “longstanding relationship with Imperial and fund a significant amount of [other] work at Imperial.” The spokesman added that Arthritis Research UK “believe in working with the best talent that the UK has to offer”.

The Kennedy Institute has enjoyed success and contributed significantly to the field with important research such as the discovery of TNFα (Tumour Necrosis Factor), a type of protein that plays a large part in a specific type of arthritis. This led to the realisation that blocking this protein can alleviate the symptoms of the condition.

The Directors of the Kennedy Institute have also enjoyed global recognition, receiving several awards each. Notably, Professor Sir Feldmann received a knighthood in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list last June.

The Kennedy Institute was first formed in 1965 with a foundation gift from the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology Trust formerly known as the Mathilda and Terence Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology Trust (Mathilda being the daughter of Marks & Spencer founder Michael Marks) and the original site was found in Bute Gardens. In 1997, Arthritis Research UK relocated the Institute closer to the medical school at Charing Cross Hospital.
