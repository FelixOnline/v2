Considering my age it’s hard for me imagine that, at one time, Madonna was the biggest star in the world. Unfortunately though, often with a great music career comes a terrible film career. Anyone who’s seen _Swept Away_ or _The Next Best Thing_ should know that she’s never set the bar high for musicians-turned-actors. For ease of list-making I’ve excluded artists from the 50s and 60s because starring in shitty films seemed to be a requirement in those times (here’s looking at you Elvis):

_Beyoncé Knowles_

Long before she was dominating the Super Bowl half-time show and releasing music videos which warrant short-film status themselves, Beyoncé was a budding film star. The leading role most people now remember Queen Bey for is her portrayal of Deena Jones in the utterly fabulous _Dream Girls_. One thing you guarantee when you cast Beyoncé is a cracking tie-in single and _Dream Girls_’ ‘Listen’ is no exception.

_Yasiin Bey (Mos Def)_

I’ve admitted my enjoyment of several films in this section that should get my film-writer badge torn from my metaphorical jacket. One that should get a lot of nerd blood boiling is my love for the _Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy_ film –  this is coming from someone who’s read the entire book series. Bey’s Ford Prefect was easily the best part of this film, and the rapper has also stolen scenes in many others, including _The Italian Job_ remake.

_Justin Timberlake_

Considering his superstar status, Justin Timberlake’s movie career success came as little surprise. Timberlake has now starred in several features from Rom-Coms (to be expected) to serious dramas. Admittedly, one need only watch _Black Snake Moan_ to know he’s no DeNiro, but the charisma that made him so successful in music also lends something special to his films. Special shout out to _The Social Network._
