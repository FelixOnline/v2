_5 stars_

I had no idea of what kind of show to expect, 
Swayed to attend by media buzz and the prospect 
Of seeing James McAvoy - live on stage! 
A welcome break from his golden age 
Of threequels and reboots,
Green screens and CGI substitutes, 
Blockbuster, record-buster, 
So-called cinematic filibuster. 

How glad was I to have witnessed something so spectacular 
As a (very French) love story told in British vernacular:
Boy, Cyrano de Bergerac (James McAvoy), a masterful wordsmith, 
In love with 
Girl, Roxane (Anita Joy Uwajeh), brains, beauty and balls, 
Who’s fallen for 
Other boy, Christian (Eben Figueiredo), handsome and attractive, 
Although, unfortunately, mentally… inactive. 
Might I add that Cyrano is disfigured
With a nose so big Pinocchio would be triggered.

Remarkably, with Jamie Lloyd’s direction and aesthetic, 
Cyrano appears with no olfactory prosthetic,
A comment, perhaps, on self-perception –
What holds us back is often of our own creation.
Likewise, the stage had a minimalist air,
Devoid of props, save some microphones and chairs,
Turning the audience’s sole focus on
Each line of the script, a linguistic phenomenon. 

Highest praise to Martin Crimp, translator-adaptor,
For managing to capture
The magic of verse and rhyme
Sorely missed from current playwriting paradigm.
Through vocabulary, rhythm, accent, and meter,
Each character was presented a fully-formed feature.
MacAvoy shone as tortured poet,
Brimming with talent and not afraid to show it.
In fact, the whole cast was absolutely stunning,
Although out of all of them I was mostly gunning
For Nima Taleghani’s Ligniere,
Whose cheeky demeanour and cockneyed diction aired
A more vulnerable trait and delicate soul
Than the traditional drunken-best-friend reading of the role.

Crimp’s Cyrano de Bergerac is a novel adaptation
That revels in its celebration
Of words and language and unpitched sound
(There’s even beatboxing! I guess “in for a penny, in for a pound”),
Move over Hamilton, there’s a new guy in town
Looking to take your verbal gymnastics crown.
His name is Cyrano de Bergerac
And he’s bringing rhyming couplets back.
