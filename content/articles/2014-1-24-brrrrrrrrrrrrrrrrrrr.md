As its title suggests, Walt Disney’s brand new animation film is all about the cold, which is just as well, given the appropriate period of its release date. There is so much snow, a lot of wind, and plenty of ice to get you into the winter mood if you weren’t already. Loosely based on Hans Christen Andersen’s story _The Snow Queen_, we have Elsa (Idina Menzel), a young princess who can conjure up all things related to winter. A potentially fatal accident has her parents worrying for the safety of her younger sister, Anna (Kristen Bell). From that point on, Elsa is forever separated from Anna and the two start living different lives.

After a tragic shipwreck leaves their parents dead, it’s Elsa’s turn to take the crown and rule over her kingdom. An accident of epic proportions occurs as her powers are no longer a secret to the people, and her once-warm, sunny hometown is thrown into the miserable, blistering cold. Casting herself into exile, Elsa builds herself a fancy new ice castle whilst singing the film’s highlight song ‘Let it Go’ that emphasises how strong and independent a woman she is and how she can make it on her own without having to change or be ashamed of who she is. It’s powerfully sung by the original green Wicked Witch Elphaba, Menzel, who blasts through the tough notes and leaves a memorable impression of her moment.

Whilst Elsa is living her feminist dream in the winter mountains, Anna too, is on a feminist quest of her own to bravely venture out into the wilderness to find her sister and to bring back the sun to the lands. Anna is the one with the most patience in the film, as she is constantly kept in the dark about everything, and yet taking such treatment so well. She is accompanied by a male traveller, although for the most part he takes the back seat. Yes, this is possibly the first ever Disney animated film that is so upfront and driven about its female protagonists. Feminists are right to rejoice about this one, as neither Elsa nor Anna are after the fulfilment of finding the one man who will automatically solve all their problems. In fact if anything, it’s the men who complicate things.

It’s a refreshing turn in a well-worked formula of the past, and although the opening scenes do hint at a cringe-inducing love subplot, that’s all cleared up towards the end in a slightly more sinister twist than one might originally expect.

That the two ladies are voiced by such high-spirited voice actors works to the film’s advantage. And this being a Disney film, there are plenty of songs taked with a lot of the storytelling. Menzel and Bell share some well-harmonised, pleasant duets, although they’re not exactly the types of songs that immediately stick to your head. There have only been sporadic periods of brilliance when it comes to Disney’s original film soundtrack of late, and with _Frozen_, apart from the aforementioned ‘Let It Go’ (even though that song itself doesn’t capture the former grandeur of other Disney greats) its musical offerings are considerably weak.

Where the film excels however, is with its infinitely beautiful and creative animated visuals. Winter has never looked more sparkly and whenever Elsa plays around with her incredible powers, the film generates images and sequences that are truly a marvellous spectacle. Their kingdom of Arendelle serves as a majestic set-up for the scenes set within the palace walls along its beautiful corridors and interiors, and even out in the wilderness, the harsh nature presents an eerie dose of beauty.

Of course there is the obligatory need for a loyal, trusted animal companion, plus some reliable comic relief. These roles are filled by Olaf (Josh Gad), a snowman whose warmth and naivete are a time-worthy addition to the film (although his ill-advised obsession for the heat and summer does translate into an entirely forgettable sequence of his only song), as well as Sven the reindeer who acts as a trusty riding companion of Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), the man who becomes the reluctant travelling companion of Anna.

What the film lacks is a strong, memorable antagonist to sustain the plot’s momentum. The final climax and showdown is unimpressive to say the least, and to say that the resolution to all the previously set-up problems is rushed would be a massive understatement. Everything is sorted in a single, anticlimactic flash, and with such a well-structured build-up the pay-off should have been a bigger spectacle.

But in the end _Frozen_ certainly demonstrates that Disney still has plenty of magic up its sleeves, and that their next few offerings will be worth waiting around for.
