  As the year draws to a close, many societies will begin the transition to a
  new committee. Running a society at Imperial is not easy, and perhaps the
  hardest part of running a society is planning the associated events. A lot of
  things have to be taken into consideration when preparing for them. You want
  to plan events that not only engage your current members, but are also
  inviting to new members and give the wider community a glimpse of what exactly
  your society is about.  We’re going to put it out there. Planning events isn’t
  easy. If you’re not struggling to book a venue, you’re emailing external
  speakers, or perhaps even trying to convince your members to come – the list
  really does go on. However, what I’ve found is that one of the most
  understatedly difficult choices to make when planning an event, is choosing
  what platform to host your tickets on. The process and ease of ticket
  procurement sets the tone for the rest of the event. An easy and smooth ticket
  purchasing process puts the customer at ease, and incites excitement for the
  event. You might choose Eventbrite, or you might choose to sell through the
  Union. Using the Union, you don’t get the revenue from ticket sales until
  after the event has taken place. What happens if you need the money urgently,
  for example to book the venue? Damn. On the other hand, when using Eventbrite,
  the company takes a percentage of the revenue from your ticket sales AND they
  don’t give you the money until after the event has been held. Double damn.
  What if we told you we have the solution to your problems?  Reverb is a
  ticketing platform made by students. We are a professional, creative team of
  undergraduates who understand (trust me, we do) just how hard it is to plan
  events. We know the kind of experience and vibe you want your members to have
  when they attend your events, and we are passionate about helping you execute
  that vision. Our passion is managing behind-the-scenes details so our clients
  don’t have to worry about them.  With Reverb, we provide tickets at a lower
  cost than all our other competitors (we’ve done all the research, so you don’t
  have to). In addition, we have early pay-out options, which provide you with a
  variable proportion of revenue from ticket sales before the event has been
  held. This helps you improve your short-term cash flow position, so you have
  the funds needed to improve your event. It’s a win-win for everyone!  If
  you’re interested about finding out more about Reverb, or you’d like to
  register early interest, visit our website reverbintl.com.  We can’t wait to
  hear from you guys!
