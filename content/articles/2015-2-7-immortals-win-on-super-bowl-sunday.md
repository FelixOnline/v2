Sunday 1st February saw the Immortals take a trip to the seaside to face Brighton Tsunami for the second time in the season. The first time saw the Immortals dominate with a 12-6 win at home. The team all packed onto the coach at 8am for the two-hour drive to Brighton; looking ready to take the second, and most important, win of the season. This game was the most important in the Immortals’ season because it almost certainly decided who would be relegated from the Premiership South division. The game started well with strong running from Emanuel Olagbaju and Rayane Jackson as well as good blocking from the offensive line, something that would become a theme throughout the match. However, unfortunately something else that would become a theme was the Immortals offense struggling to finish their long drives down the pitch with a touchdown.

The Immortals defense looked as strong as ever putting huge pressure on the quarterback with Jack Cordrey getting an impressive sack as well as Jorn getting his hand on their signal-caller. Bob Worksfromhomealone laid down a huge hit on their quarterback taking him out of the game in the second half. The offense made things difficult for themselves with copious penalties on the day taking away two touchdowns and extending their driving distance. The only points scored in the match were a safety, scoring 2 points, because Brighton’s punter managed to punt the ball out of the back of his own endzone when strong winds took the ball. Having said that the Immortals should have put up more points considering the offensive pressure and the defensive dominationdiscipline was lacking on the day, which made the match closer than it deserved to be.

The Most Valuable Players (MVP) of the day were: Jorn Jorg (Overall MVP for solid work put in on offence and defense), Henry ‘has a big head’ Turner (Offensive MVP for strong blocking on the line), Little Harry Collini (Line MVP for putting in big blocks on offensive line and dominating on defensive line) and Panukorn ‘Teddy’ Taleongpongdong (Defensive MVP for an overall great performance on defense). After winning the game, the team went on to host the Superbowl party at the Union, which was a successful and entertaining night that saw the New England Patriots defeat the Seattle Seahawks 28-24 in amazing circumstances. Now the team looks forward to playing Hertfordshire on Sunday 8th February and ACC on Wednesday 4th February where the James Alden award will continue to be fought for.
