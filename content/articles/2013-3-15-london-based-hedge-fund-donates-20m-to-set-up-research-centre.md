A London-based Hedge Fund, [Brevan Howard](http://www.brevanhoward.com/), have decided to donate £20.1 million ($30 million) to Imperial College in order to set up a finance research centre after them.

The money will be given to the Business School at Imperial; the founder of the hedge fund, Alan Howard, studied Chemical Engineering at Imperial.

The research centre will be named the Brevan Howard Centre for Finance. The focus of the research centre has not yet been decided, it is thought to incorporate the changes in the financial industry subsequent to the economic crisis. Mr Howard commented “I think the crisis has generated a different set of questions that have traditionally been taught in Business School.”

The hedge fund was founded by Brevan Howard in 2002,it manages approximately $39 billion. Last year, the Sunday times estimated that Mr. Howard’s personal wealth is about $2,2 billion.
