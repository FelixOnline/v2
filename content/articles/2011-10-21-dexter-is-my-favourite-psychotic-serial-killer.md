Jeff Lindsay’s book ‘Darkly Dreaming Dexter’ (which I’m told is very good) is the basis for Showtime’s multi award winning program Dexter. The protagonist, who gives the show its name, is cunning, brutal and funny. By day he’s a blood spatter analyst for Miami Metro Police Department. By night, a serial killer. What sets Dexter apart from other protagonists is that he’s a normal human - he makes mistakes: he’s no Jack Bauer or Michael Schofield (24 and Prison Break, respectively).

We are first introduced to our lead as he gives a sinister sounding monologue backed by equally chilling music (written by Daniel Licht) whilst driving through the night towards his first victim. The viewers are immediately informed that Dexter is a killer first and foremost; demonstrated only a few minutes later where we see him beginning to clinically cut up his prey.

As the first season develops we learn more about Dexter and the writers begin to reveal why he is as he is; why he carries his so called “dark passenger”; his homicidal inner voice, if you like. This alter ego is put to good use when challenged by the “ice-truck killer” - an unknown assailant who captures his victims (all prostitutes), mutilates them and then leaves them literally bloodless for the police to find. As the plot thickens, the killer leaves clues for Dexter, to lure him in and to ‘play’ with him. The challenge is unduly accepted by our favourite serial killer with some gripping consequences.

Dexter manages to be captivating, mysterious, sad and brutally dark at the same time. It’s definitely worth watching.
