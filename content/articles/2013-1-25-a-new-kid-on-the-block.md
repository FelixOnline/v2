This week [The Tab Imperial ](http://imperial.tab.co.uk/)launched, a new online news source that focuses on news and life of being student at Imperial and around London.

The Tab will be updating hopefully daily, and we are aiming to be your one stop shop for news and views online after you’ve finished ranting on sexism comment articles on the Felix website.

Much like Felix, we are constantly looking for writers for both features and news. Unlike Felix, we are run entirely on a part time basis so there are lots of opportunities available for you to really take control of a large portion of the site and do with it what you will! The Tab network is a well-known national student journalism brand, and if you are interested in online journalism, this is a really great opportunity to get some good experience.

As we’re online, if you have any funny videos or photos from around campus then we can be the place to share them with the wider community. We’re also looking for enthusiastic animators and photoshoppers, as well as video editors and presenters to produce content for the site.

So where to get started? Well you canvisit our website imperial.tab.co.uk, like us on Facebook at [facebook.com/TheTabImperial ](http://facebook.com/TheTabImperial )or follow us on Twitter at [@TheTabImperial](https://twitter.com/TheTabImperial)

If you want to get in-touch, email me at [editor@imperialtab.co.uk ](mailto:editor@imperialtab.co.uk)or through the Facebook group.
