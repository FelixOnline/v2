Imperial’s Sports Partnership has recently sent an email to stakeholder of the annual Varsity match outlining changes to the acceptance of alcohol during the event.

The declared Varsity Day Alcohol Policy affirms that the focus of the Varsity event should be on “sporting competition”. The email cited a significant number of incidents related to alcohol consumption and how they were inappropriate at a sporting competition.

In preparation for Varsity 2014 several changes have been put in place which will affect the use of alcohol during the day including:”

Alcohol can no longer be taken onto coaches.

Participants and spectators will be unable to carry externally purchased alcohol onto College/Union/The Stoop owned premises.

Any personal supply of alcohol found on said premises will be confiscated.

People who are judged to be overly intoxicated by Harlequins security will not be given permission to enter The Stoop.”
