For the fourth year in a row the talented dancers at Imperial have come together to show you what they are made of. The DI Show 2018 returns next week!

The show is a collaborative venture between the six dance societies at Imperial (Belly Dance, Dance Club, Dance Company, Funkology, ICSM Dance, Pole & Aerial) brought together under Dance Imperial (DI). Every year exciting collaborations are choreographed to celebrate the differing styles and highlight their similarities. Expect to marvel at the fusions of contemporary & jazz, cabaret belly & tap, and a few more exciting crossovers!

Not a dancer? Or not sure what the dance styles are? Here is a brief overview of what you can expect to see! In this year’s show we have: traditional (cabaret) belly dance, tribal fusion belly dance (blending modern dance with traditional belly), Hiphop & foundation (grooves, popping, locking), breakdance, pole, aerial, ballet, contemporary, jazz, tap, ballroom, tango, latin, salsa, and Bachata. All of these styles hold weekly classes and rehearsals, offering beginner level classes...so if you feel inspired after the show just give it a go. There is just so much dance at Imperial to choose from – if only you could be studying dance rather than stuck in the library!

Whether it be from the winter workshop weekend in November, to choreographer speed dating, creating exciting fusions for the show or the many hours spent rehearsing, the DI Committee has worked tirelessly to ensure its ethos – collaboration between all the dancers at imperial – flourishes. The show promises to celebrate all this hard work.

Bell Dance, Dance Club, Dance Company, Funkology, and Pole & Aerial have all competed in many competitions across the country this year before the show. Between them they have won numerous awards and you will get the chance to view these fantastic pieces on stage! ICSM Dance have also been working hard behind the scenes and are excited to perform.

If that wasn’t enough you will also witness this year’s four performance-only collaboration pieces. This is the only opportunity to watch these spectacles in one awe-inspiring show. Don’t want to miss out? Tickets are already selling rapidly so make sure to buy online ASAP (http://bit.ly/2oi6egX)!
