It’s summer; exams are over, there are parties to go to, holiday destinations to jet off to, and of course, the Summer Ball to attend. For many of us, all of these occasions probably warrant new clothes.

Given the emphasis placed upon sustainable living nowadays, however, there can’t help being some guilt attached to a trip to Westfield when you know you are funding an industry that promotes a throw-away philosophy. The realm of fashion is well known for its somewhat lax stance on sustainability, characterised by fleeting trends that seem to come and go each month let alone each season. In some respects it seems that, because of this trait of the fashion world, extravagance and wastefulness are inextricably a part of it, but does it have to be this way?

In recent months there have been many signs that the fashion industry may be redeeming itself of its wasteful reputation. In March, H&M launched their Glamour Conscious Collection featuring clothes made from sustainable materials like hemp and recycled polyester. In April, Marks and Spencer unveiled their new Schwapping Lab, endorsed by Joanna Lumley, where people can give and buy second hand clothes. Even better, this month, in fact today, Topshop are launching their Capsule Collection: a range of clothes, designed in collaboration with the eco-friendly group Reclaim to Wear, made entirely from discarded materials including fashion industry surplus such as cut-offs.
> Sadly, sustainable fashion still doesn't seem to be considered glamorous enough to make the headlines
In order to do some vital ‘research’, I paid a visit to the Oxford Street H&M and Topshop stores and although it’s great that these green ranges have been launched, there was hardly any sign of publicity for them either in the shops, or in magazines or on TV. Sadly, sustainable fashion still doesn’t seem to be considered glamorous enough to make the headlines. Even more disappointingly, Topshop’s recycled range will only be available at the Oxford Street store. It seems that, although celebrity endorsements, and events such as Livia Firth’s Green Carpet Challenge, encouraging celebrities to don recycled fashion items at red carpet events, are raising awareness on the issue of sustainable fashion, there just isn’t enough enthusiasm from the big brands.

On the bright side, living in London, we have some of the best destinations for vintage clothes shopping in the country, with places like Brick Lane and Camden market on our doorstep there’s plenty of opportunity to shop in a way that’s kind to the planet if not our pockets. If you do have some free time today though, Topshop is the place to be, their brand new range is the perfect excuse to hit the shops, after all how often can you say you’re shopping to save the world!?
