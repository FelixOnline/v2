After the initial blinding from the blonde hair and the fake tans, we collected as a team. RomVom slotted in a quickie, smoothly followed by a mid air bitch slap into the net from 3 x a Fish, and we pulled ahead. Some great defending protected Fresher Wearing III from the formidable Jacky Essex with FrauBrau and Fresher Brave pushing hard up the right (shaft). Double Decker and Fresher Me scared them away from our D with their very real hair… Suffering from a bad bout of hat trick avoidance and ably assisted by Shark Bait (ooh ha ha) 3 x scored again. Dominating in the first half, we gave them a charity goal, cos ya know, they’re from Essex. Some great one-two’s, aerials, drag flicks and general reem tekers from the solid centre playaz U Bender, WC and Tenth Hole led to a 3-1 half time score line. Some rousing chat from Banana Split and Willy Board direction from Reginald Maximilian Tarquin Clarence “Pete” Duke of Egham, encouraged some great all round work in the second half. They were well jel though, and OMG, copied our stick and ball handling skills to get a second in. Despite their dazzling vajazzling, old hats Sucky Sucky and Herpes held the line. Final whistle babes. Game over. #3-2 #OMG #babes #ICHC #ladies1s #SX #winning
