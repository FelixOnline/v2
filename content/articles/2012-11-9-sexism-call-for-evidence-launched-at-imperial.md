 - I think I get elements of what you are saying but on others I am a little lost Just to comment on the point of isms this campaign it being run to see if students do respond to this kind of campaign I dont think any of the isms are more important than other isms I sort of think your issue of assholery is the same as the problem of a culture that has been allowed to develop at Imperial I am not really sure what else to respond to as I am a little lost the fact that it is spread into four comments which is not your fault is making my brain hurtThe point of this is definitely not to alienate anyone  lets not open the can of worms about that article please I am not sure I agree with your point with the distinction between assholerypure sexism but that is fair enough And dont worry I will be aiming to sort out all of the ismsfacets of assholerydiscrimination one at a time I dont mean to trivialise anything I just dont expect to be able to make change over nightI agree it wo

Let me start by introducing myself, I am [Becky Lane](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/your-union/your-representatives/sabbatical-officers/becky-lane) and I am this year’s Deputy President (Welfare) and I have just finished my Physics degree at Imperial College. Although my experiences here as an undergraduate here at Imperial have generally been fine (aside from the OH-MY-GOD-EXAMS-ARE-SO-BAD) there are times that I have felt marginalised because of my gender. I seemed to blunder

through the years of my undergraduate course in blissful ignorance of this undercurrent of sexism, which I feel is often part of the Imperial culture. In my little bubble of friends I remained on the whole oblivious, until I stepped into the spotlight cast by Union politics and elections. I was generally an outsider to the Union fold before I ran for my Sabbatical position. I won’t dredge up the past, but during campaigning I was subjected to derogatory comments based upon my gender. I was incredibly angry, taking the point of view that I am happy for people to criticise me based upon my views, but not my looks.

This year, the[ Physics society has already been mentioned in the Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/slut-dropping-and-pimps-and-hoes--the-sexual-politics-of-freshers-week-8203400.html) regarding an email sent out which caused offence to some female first year students and rightly so. The attitudes towards this email that I have come across have been at times quite frankly horrifying. Such as ‘the person who sent this email was a female so therefore it can’t be sexist’. Comments of this nature are not down to the gender of the person that made them or indeed the intent of how they were made; the only concern

should be that individuals found them offensive. I am proud to say that this year things are being highlighted to me passed on from the Gender Equality officer; it worries me that in the past incidents may have gone unreported.

So, what are we going to do? I can’t help but feel that there might be a cultural issue here at Imperial. Is it because we are an institution with the percentage of females fluctuating between 34-36%? Honestly I don’t know but I want to find out. The answer I feel is not to hold a Sexism survey, but to adopt the

approach that the government takes when gathering information about Higher Education. So this article is here to introduce my call for evidence. The email account [sexism@imperial.ac.uk](mailto:sexism@imperial.ac.uk?subject=Sexism%20call%20for%20evidence) is now active. I am happy to receive anonymous or named responses from any student or staff member who would like to get down their attitudes towards sexism and experiences of gender discrimination and Imperial College.

I might be completely off the mark here but I hope to gain answers to some of these questions. Is Imperial College a sexist environment? At times do both male and female students fell discriminated against because of their gender? Have you ever felt during your studies you have been treated differently because of your gender? These are just some of the questions that I hope to get the answers to.

Making a call for evidence is all very well and good, but what am I going to do with this information? Well I plan to display the submissions in a public place in College in an artistic way; I also plan to
> I plan to display the submissions in a public place in College in an artistic way; I also plan to produce the Sexism @ Imperial report to present to College
produce the Sexism @ Imperial report to present to College. An institutional problem needs an institutional shift in attitude to make a change. This is also creating an anonymous way for students to report issues of sexism even after the report is made. To make an anonymous submission you can just create a hotmail account merely for the purpose of making the submission, or if you send it from your personal account your name will never be mentioned. The only people with access will be the Deputy President (Welfare) and the Gender Equality officer. Help us answer some of these questions and make a difference.
