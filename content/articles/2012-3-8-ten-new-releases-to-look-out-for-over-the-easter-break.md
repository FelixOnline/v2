__We Bought a Zoo (16 March)__

Aimed at a large Christmas audience in the States, the significant delay in the U.K. release suggests the studio is banking on the warm, spring reception here in Europe. Which is just as well, because Cameron Crowe’s feel-good family drama involving lots of furry animals (the title makes this clear) is an ideal film for both the older and younger generations. In a very _Jerry Maguire_-type of plot, Matt Damon, who plays a likable widower, quits his job in the city and decides to relocate to the quieter, brighter countryside with his two young children, and ends up buying a zoo for his house. Let the redemptive reconnection between a parent and kids begin, as well as blossoming new romance with a local hottie (Scarlett Johansson).

__The Hunger Games (23 March)__

Based on the popular young adult novel, industry experts are hopeful that the ticket sales for this will match the hype that went with the Twilight franchise. While it’s still too early to be making bold estimates like that, the _Battle Royale_-esque plot involving a futuristic world in which 24 unfortunately selected teenagers are first trained and then forced to fight for their lives until there is only one survivor, a “game” that is watched by everyone. Intense and gripping, although the 12A certificate suggests there will be less blood. This also has the advantage of having secured two rapidly rising stars of Hollywood as the main leads: the Oscar-nominated, gutsy Jennifer Lawrence and _The Kids are All Right_’s Josh Hutcherson.

__The Kid with a Bike (23 March)__

The Grand Prix winner at last year’s Cannes Film Festival (the second highest honour), the Dardenne brothers have once again succeeded in delivering a compelling, emotional rollercoaster ride. Abandoned by his own father to a foster home, 11 year-old Cyril falls into trouble as he tries to reconnect with his distant father and also retrieve his lost bicycle. He befriends a local hairdresser who agrees to care for him during the weekends, as well as a local gang member who manipulates the boy’s need for a stable father figure to take him under his wings. It has already been hailed as one of this year’s most gripping, intriguing and exciting, despite what may sound like a slow, bog-standard, foreign indie drama.

__Titanic 3D (5 April)__

Say what you will about the three-hour long film where essentially a boy and a girl who aren’t supposed to fall in love do so anyway, whilst a gigantic ship sinks after hitting an iceberg that jeopardises the lovers’ plan: the fact remains that James Cameron’s _Titanic_ walked away with 11 Oscars and a cool 1.8 unadjusted billion dollars at the worldwide box office. One of the world’s most beloved films is back, this time with a 3D conversion; considering that Cameron is the man who started this recent obsession with the extra dimension, he must have done a remarkable job. An unmissable cinematic event for fans, and perhaps even first-timers may find themselves hooked and tearing up at Leo and Kate’s doomed romance.

__This Must be the Place (6 April)__

A word of advice – brace yourselves before you get even a glimpse of the poster of this film. Sean Penn has never looked this scary. And this is the man who’s played convicted criminals in the past. No, this time he’s a bored, retired rock star, a soft-spoken, slightly spaced out individual. After his estranged father’s unexpected death, he goes on a very personal trip around America to find an ex-Nazi officer who tormented his Jewish father in Auschwitz. This kind of eccentric character is absolutely ideal for the kind of diverse and unique actor that Penn is, and a self-discovery road-trip is always a good starting point for a touching and beautiful journey of what appears to be an interesting character.

__The Cabin in the Woods (13 April)__

Before you roll your eyes and dismiss this as yet another predictable slasher horror in which attractive youngsters are killed off one by one by a deranged psychopath after the group makes the foolish mistake of going to an abandoned house in the middle of nowhere, have a closer look at the trailer. To start off with, these unfortunate people are harassed by not one serial killer, but instead a secret, well-organised group which seems to be equipped with hi-tech terrorising resources. Produced by Joss Whedon, the man behind_ Buffy_ and this summer’s much anticipated _Avengers Assemble_, _The Cabin in the Woods_ could be that rare horror film that carries with it some originality as well as some genuinely scary moments.

__Jeff, Who Lives at Home (20 April)__

From the director of _Cyrus_, 2010’s well-received indie comedy, comes _Jeff, Who Lives at Home_, the heart-warming yet unexpectedly funny story of the aimless slacker Jeff (Jason Segel) living in the basement of his mother’s (Susan Sarandon) house, and his married brother (Ed Helms). “You may not be able to change your dysfunctional family, but destiny, you can take control of,” is the tagline this film is trying to sell. When his brother suspects that his wife (Judy Greer) may be cheating, Jeff helps with the spying process. The Duplass brothers, having both written and directed the film, have assembled a killer cast, and all the festival attention this has been receiving bodes well for the film’s overall quality.

__Salmon Fishing in the Yemen (20 April)__

This must have been an absolute nightmare to finance and advertise for, given its highly unappealing title – fishing itself is an acquired-taste kind of activity, take this to the Yemen and you’ll have an even smaller audience. But Lasse Hallström, known for his heart-warming dramas (_Chocolat, Hachi: A Dog’s Tale, Dear John_), is the reliable man in charge telling the story of a fisheries expert (Emily Blunt), a consultant (Ewan McGregor), and a hopeful Sheik (Amr Waked) coming together to bring the sport of fly-fishing to the desert of Yemen. Despite the seemingly bland subject material, Blunt and McGregor form a likable team, and Kristin Scott Thomas pitches in some fine comic performance as an ambitious politician.

__Albert Nobbs (27 April)__

Glenn Close is now a six-time Oscar nominee thanks to her latest passion project. Adapting a play she performed around thirty years ago, her performance has won rave reviews since its release last year, and it finally hits the screens here. The tragic story of a woman living disguised as a male butler in 19th century Ireland to survive and make ends meet in the sexist society, Close never sets a foot wrong in portraying the paranoid woman trapped within the walls she built for her protection. It’s a touching, gentle and subtle drama that also makes good use of its excellent ensemble. Janet McTeer also nabbed an Oscar nomination as the person providing support for Close, whereas Mia Wasikowska is her usual charming self.

__American Reunion (2 May)__

The original American Pie gang is back, 9 years after their _American Wedding_ stint. Times have changed, their living situations have changed, but have they really grown up? Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) are busy bringing up their two year-old son, Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is a married househusband, Oz (Chris Klein) has a new hot squeeze, and Stifler (Seann William Scott) is still Stifler, but with a job this time (we see him defecating in a picnic basket so maybe thankfully for the audience, he hasn’t quite matured). Also back are Jim’s Dad (Eugene Levy) and Stifler’s Mom (Jennifer Coolidge) who end up in the same bedroom. Will the destined pair finally hook up in this instalment? Only time will tell.
