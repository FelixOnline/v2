The newly redesigned Exhibition Road saw its [grand opening take place last Wednesday](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/2121/exhibition-road-closes-for-grand-opening-/). Away from the usual buffoonery (read: metal elephants that Felix still doesn’t quite comprehend perfectly) and tussles for photo opportunities that accompany any form of visit from the current Mayor of London the fact remains that the redesign cost £30m, and while the visual changes are plain to see, the reasoning behind them is somewhat muddier.

The designers have promised that despite what seems like an unintuitive idea to begin with (namely a lack of solid guidelines for traffic or crossings for pedestrians), there will ultimately prove to be a bevy of improvements over the previous design, including a reduction in traffic by 30% and an increased observation by both driver and pedestrian. For £30m, one would certainly hope so. Nevertheless, in its current state, ‘increased observation’ will most likely prove to be a synonym for ‘anxious watching’ as students attempt to find the best area to cross a road with an ever changing traffic flow, and motorists (some of whom, of course, will be unfamiliar with the new layout) attempt to avoid potentially grim consequences as students, tourists and other pedestrians edge out from behind parked cars.

The reduction in road signs is mystifying. For such a laissez-faire attitude to be thrust upon users of the road, one would have to place a great deal of faith in road users. However, many who use the road aren’t regular residents, such as tourists for museums and the surrounding area. A prime example is the roundabout at the corner with Prince Consort Road. Situated on a prime route to Ethos, it is a popular location to cross for students. Now, turning for cars is only vaguely regulated. Confusion reigns, especially when car indicators are not even used.

Consider the behaviour of motorists on Queen’s Gate and the surrounding area. Particularly at busy times, little consideration can often be shown to those waiting at zebra crossings. As problems still exist in other locations around campus, whether due to the location of crossings or other traffic regulations that could be improved, is it really time to give drivers more free rein?

While pioneering schemes such as the Exhibition Road redesign are to be admired for their scope and ambition, one can’t help but feel that there has been a major oversight with the new layout with regards to the public and many students who use the road everyday. Despite the shine of the newly cleaned museums, we mustn’t be dazzled by the aesthetic impact. Traffic around campus is still a key issue and hasn’t yet been cracked. We must study the new Exhibition Road and determine for ourselves whether an improvement is incoming any time soon.
