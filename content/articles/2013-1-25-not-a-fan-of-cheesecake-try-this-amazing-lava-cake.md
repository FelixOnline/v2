It really is simple, cheap and absolutely divine. It will take you about 10 minutes to make and it only needs 15 minutes in the oven. So, in less than 30 minutes and with minimum effort you can also have this amazing dessert.

You will need 6 ramekins.

__Ingredients:__

1 1/2 cupsall purpose flour

1/3 cup goodquality cocoa

1/2 cup sugar

1/2 cup brown sugar

1/3 cup sunflower oil
 1 cup (preferably almond) milk

Seeds of 1 vanilla pod

2 tbsp vinegar

1 tsp baking soda

1/2 cup chocolate chips

6 ramekins

__Procedure:__

Preheat your oven at 180 degrees.

Place parchment paper in 6 ramekins and lightly grease them.

In a bowl mix the almond milk, the oil, the vinegar and the vanilla seeds. Set aside and leave for about 15 minutes or until it curdles.

In a separate bowl sift the flour, cocoa and soda. Add the sugar and mix well.

Add the wet ingredients to the dry mixture and mix until just combined. Be very careful not to overmix as this will develop the gluten in the flour and your cakes will not be light and fluffy.

Fill 1/3 of the ramekins with the mixture and then add a tbsp of chocholate chips in each one of them. Then put the rest of the mixture on top so that the ramekins are 2/3 full.
 Bake for about 12-15 minutes. Once baked, remove from the oven and serve the lava cakes hot. They are great with hazelnut ice-cream! Enjoy!
