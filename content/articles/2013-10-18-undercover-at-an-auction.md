I’ve always been intrigued by the mystery which surrounds the highly opulent-looking establishment that is Christie’s in South Kensington, never more so than when I traversed past it in my first year as a fresher on the route to campus from Evelyn Gardens. When one of its most recent sales came up on “Travel, Science and Natural History”, it seemed to be too good an opportunity to miss.
 Christie’s was founded by James Christie in the late 18th century, and has grown into a household name across the world. However, they are not what you would expect from many hours of watching daytime TV such as Treasure Hunt (yes, I know, but I couldn’t be bothered to change the channel). Everything is conducted with precision and a hint of ruthlessness.

I simply love their catalogue, which is beautifully printed in a glossy magazine which can be picked up by the counter in the foyer, continuous with the main auction area. On one side it is lined by high tables where Christie’s trained telephone staff sit, whilst the other side had framed paintings hung at eye level for you to peruse at leisure, of which many would be sold during the day.

I was tempted to register for a paddle (the numbered plate you make a bid with), but seeing a 28cm wide meteorite go for an astounding £3500, I decided window-shopping is not such a bad idea!
 Five minutes into the bidding, I was already baffled. The auctioneer frequently addressed the online bidders, somehow knowing exactly where they were from (“£3000 from online bid in Japan”) whilst taking their bid to the telephone bidders and those in the room. He spoke at lightening pace and fired questions at those in the room as well as the staff who were on with bidders over the phone, whilst simultaneously acknowledging the presence of these online bidders. I was perplexed. Where was he getting the information from? Unless they were speaking in tongues, I hadn’t the foggiest idea.
 The staff at Christie’s kindly pointed it out to me: there is a small screen facing the auctioneer with online bids from buyers across the globe who have registered prior to the auction online, displaying their country of origin and bidding amount as the auction was being streamed live on their website.
 If you happen to have saved money since the start of term, you might have been interested in a 1719 early Italian binocular telescope, a bohemian tellurian, or even an early English terrestrial globe. The problem is in order to see the actual collections, you have to come before the auction day to the galleries at the back of the office where they are displayed. I happened to see the Japan-themed collection and they have some amazing stuff!

To the scientists amongst you (yes, you), the name Ivan Petrovich Pavlov will not be unfamiliar to you. I was mesmerised, with bated breath, as the bidding started for the first edition manuscript of Pavlov’s celebrated lectures on physiology of digestion, for which he won the Nobel Prize in 1904. With just a flick of a wrist, a click of a mouse, the buyers faced stiff competition from all sides as they clamoured to obtain ownership of this rare collection. With each exchange, the price increased: £2500, £3000, £3500.... And with a final shake of the head in the room, the manuscript went for a whopping £7000, more than triple the estimate!

You could feel the tension in the air when bidding started, and watch open-mouthed as people battled to get what they wanted. The added bonus of seeing the collections before they are sold off to private collectors was worth the time, and if you happen to be around the area, go to Christie’s and step into another world. You never know what you will find in the treasure trove.

Christie’s South Kensington is located on 85 Old Brompton Rd, SW7 3LD. Auctions are free to attend, with no need to register.
