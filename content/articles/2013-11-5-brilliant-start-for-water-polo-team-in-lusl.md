Following the loss of many excellent players this year, namely ex Team GB vice-captain Adam, we were worried we’d find a team with as much quality and finesse as our old BUCS team this year. Fortunately we did some great work at the Fresher’s Fair and managed to recruit several outstanding players, including some girls who were actually familiar with the game, which is rare. Not to mention the guys we got, who certainly know how to handle their balls.
 Our first fixture, last week, saw us pitted against UCL’s 2nd team, a team we were initially quietly confident we would beat with ease. As it turns out, we didn’t have to be quiet about it at all. Final score ending 20-2 (a huge margin for Water Polo) in Imperial’s favour saw some well-deserved celebratory drinks in ULU’s “Library”. This was the first time our team had played together, with many of us not knowing each other’s names, it is a testament to how well we can complement and gel with each other as a team. The match itself began with some intimidating synchronised stretching, led by the “nutter” Livio, followed by some half-arsed widths of the pool. We scored immediately from the swim off giving us an early lead. However some dodgy refereeing saw UCL quickly equalise, but that was to be only half of their total goals scored. Imperial soon slotted 18 more passed them, with some cracking shots being flung in from everyone, apart from Stuart. Only thing to really work on was setting up a decent arc, with most of our goals coming from counter attacks, but most importantly, UCL were easily disposed of.
 The next fixture saw us travelling out to St Barts in Shadwell, where Sophie declared she felt at home once again. Upon arrival at the pool, the ladies had to wait to in the changing room whilst the men only swimming session ended, certainly a bizarre situation for all of us. A freezing cold pool meant actually having to do a decent warm up for once. Wasn’t really needed that much though as the St Barts players were knackered after only 2 quarters. They also had an illegal sized squad of about 20 players (maximum allowed being 13), almost double our elite 11 we brought along. Still, this didn’t help them in the swimming or water polo department. The refereeing was also worse than the first match, something we didn’t think possible- one referee was heard saying to a teammate “can you take over, I don’t know the rules”. Sophie was however kind enough to explain the rules on multiple occasions and even offered to take over refereeing duties at one point - sadly they declined. Again some great goals were scored, this time even Stuart got one, and James (not Edward) showed us all how to properly play Water Polo after a great drive in to pit from the arc, firing the ball past the defenceless goalie. Despite the horrendous rule breakages, we still won 9-1, a commendable victory.
 Next on the agenda is our raucous tour to Aachen, Germany this weekend which is pretty much the highlight of the Water Polo social calendar. We look forward to socialising with our German counterparts, and maybe indulging in some Water Polo with them as well.
