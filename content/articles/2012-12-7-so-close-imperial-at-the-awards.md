comments:
 - I was really scared by what I read online about Imperial social life After the first term I managed to get out clubbing at least twice a week and still getting really good grades I am absolutely not the only one I can definitely say that more than 60 of people are really social and go out a lot Some big events like FCK ME ITS CHRISTMAS had more students from Imperial than from any other university from my hall more than 80 people went to that event I feel also that the people in the Union work hard to improve the experience the societies are really good but Metric is one of the worst thing I have ever seen at least London has really good gradesIt was a beautiful and intense term and I am happier than I have ever been to have chosen Imperial

Imperial College was nominated for two [Times Higher Education Awards](http://www.the-awards.co.uk/the2012/awardscategory/awards) this year: [Most Improved Student Experience and Outstanding Support for Early Career Researchers](http://www.the-awards.co.uk/the2012/shortlist). Imperial however lost out in each category, losing to the University of Chester and the University of York respectively. The nominations; particularly for ‘Most Improved Student Experience’ ought to be good news for Imperial that has lagged behind other universities in student satisfaction ratings which has contributed to disappointing [Guardian Rankings](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/table/2012/may/21/university-league-table-2013) in recent years. (It came in 13th in the 2013 rankings behind the University of Bath, The University of Essex and perhaps most disturbingly, UCL).

The [awards that aim](http://www.the-awards.co.uk/the2012/awards) to “recognize excellence and reward extraordinary innovation, talent and imagination of UK higher education” were initiated in 2007. Judging was carried out “by a distinguished panel of experts” that included[ Sir Deian Hopkin](http://www.policyconnect.org.uk/hec/people/sir-deian-hopkin), President of the [National Library of Wales](http://www.llgc.org.uk/) and [Liam Burns](https://twitter.com/NUS_Liam), President of the [National Union of Students](http://www.nus.org.uk/). Universities that do not traditionally top the League Tables have dominated the Awards; it indicates perhaps a degree of complacency among the ‘more prestigious’ institutions. Imperial has however won awards for [‘Outstanding Contribution to Innovation and Technology’ in 2009](http://www.the-awards.co.uk/the2012/2009) and for [Outstanding Support for Early Career Researchers in 2008](http://www.the-awards.co.uk/the2012/2008)

[Times Higher Education](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/) currently ranks Imperial 8th in the world putting it in a league with MIT and Stamford and a couple of places ahead of Yale and Columbia (but a mere 49 places ahead of King’s College London). The rankings have however been criticized for the importance given to citations in calculating its rankings which has lead to a sidelining of universities whose language of instruction isn’t English. Imperial currently ranks among the Top 10 universities in the world among most major surveys including the [QS Rankings](http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2012) and [THE](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/).
