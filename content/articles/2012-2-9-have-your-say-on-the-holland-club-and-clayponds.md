The stage has been set for a discussion on the future of both the Holland Club and Clayponds. Next Thursday (February 16) will see Imperial College’s Graduate Students’ Association [host a panel on the potential changes to the status of both the Holland Club and Clayponds](http://www.facebook.com/events/247716935307061/), both without a doubt the most contentious issues affecting both staff and students at Imperial currently. If you have any interest whatsoever in the ongoing situation, then it is crucial you attend.

Online discussion, such as that demonstrated by the [‘Save the Holland Club’ Facebook campaign](http://www.facebook.com/savethehollandclub) has been notable for highlighting those who have strong feelings regarding the situation (not to mention a genuine form of respite from the sudden and ‘dramatic’ influx of ‘[Imperial Memes](http://www.facebook.com/ImperialMemes)’), and is indeed impressive by the amount of support that there has been from staff and students across college. There is only so far that this can go, however. At its heart, the vast majority of those belonging to the campaign group have their own reasoning for the Holland Club remaining unchanged by the feasibility study and will ultimately voice their opinion in line with this. The arena for opposition, for whatever reason, is restricted, especially in lieu of actual confirmation by Commercial Services as to their plans. Until now, opinions have been posted on the campaign group, with no official statement being made by Commercial Services with respect to any form of new layout, and with Commercial Services informing people that no firm decision has been made, something that the campaign group strongly suggests that in their view, is false.

Where better to instead fully clarify the entire situation than with a panel free from the confines of internet debate? This is a place where full and frank discussion can be held between attending parties, and where individuals can be questioned in the flesh, allowing for greater accountability and understanding behind the situation.

So whether you have concerns about the immediate future of Clayponds or the potential changes to the layout of the Holland Club, now is the time to take your points to those who have the power to represent your views and gain a deeper understanding of the entire situation from those who directly at the centre of any potential changes. There is no choice but to attend the meeting and make your voice heard, and to listen to all the evidence (or lack thereof) on offer in a hope for transparency, rather than alleged truths.
