Feeling the pressure of being the first team to play on the Saturday of Bottle Match, tensions were high but the raucous support on the side lines (great banners and chants all round) quickly calmed the nerves before the game began. The RSM supporters had witnessed unfortunate losses the day before and the RSM Lacrosse team were eager to give them a good performance and win to start the day correctly. Their answers were swiftly answered as the CSM cheers were almost instantly extinguished - 3 goals were scored by the RSM in the early minutes due to some great drawing from Arianna. 

The first quarter ended with an excellent 6-1 score line to the RSM. The second and third quarter continued in a similar fashion, with the highlight being a great pass from Arianna almost half the pitch up to Claudia who quickly scored after taking the ball on the crease. Goals from Arianna, Annie and Matthew during this period led to a commanding 12-4 lead to the RSM by the end of the 3rd quarter. At this point, however, it seemed as if CSM had suddenly discovered some newfound energy as the RSM team lost some vital players to hockey and they quickly rallied, scoring 2 goals past an increasingly angry RSM Goalkeeper. In the end though, RSM were not to be denied, and to the dismay of many CSM fans the RSM played keep-ball until the final whistle and the game ending 12-6.
