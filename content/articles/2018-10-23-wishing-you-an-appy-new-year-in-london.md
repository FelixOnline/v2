Whether you are new to London or you’ve always lived here, the collecton of apps in this article consists of apps many Londoners use daily, and many more you may be unaware of. Either way, they are sure to help you out if you haven’t used them before. 

**Citymapper**

If you are new to London or even if you have lived here a while, public transport can be complicated.

While you can definitely get by reading Tube or bus maps, if you want to save some time, Citymapper is the way to go. The app provides you with live updates on buses and Tube lines, and calculates the fastest routes to any destination. 

Additionally, you can see if there are any Santander bike racks nearby along with how many bikes/free spaces are available there.

**Monzo**

Monzo is a smart banking app, packed with useful features to help you manage your finances. 
Once you open a current account with Monzo, they will send you a debit card, and you can also set it up on Apple or Android pay. 

Any transaction carried out with Monzo will be automatically categorized, for example, into restaurants,  shopping, or groceries . This makes it very easy to track your spending without putting in any effort. 

Apart from being user-friendly, Monzo is also good for use abroad. For cash withdrawals from ATMs under £200 a month, there are no fees. Other spending can go over that limit without any charges.

**Instapaper**

Do you ever see an article you want to read later, and then just never come back to it? Instapaper allows you to save any article you are reading, and then it is downloaded in the Instapaper app. It’s great for catching up on your reading during long Tube journeys or whenever you do feel like it.

**Dice**
 
The aim of this app is to make buying tickets for festivals much easier. Tickets can be refunded and you are safe from having to pay more than you should. 

Dice also offers recommendations for upcoming gigs if you feel like trying something new. If you allow it to access your Apple Music or Spotify, the app tailors its recommendations to your music taste. 

Using your location, Dice can also keep you up-to-date on events happening in your area, such as across the many clubs in London.

**YoYo**

For regular customers at the various catering outlets around campus, YoYo is an app definitely worth giving a go. 

You have probably heard the name if you’ve ever bought lunch here. YoYo is essentially a kind of loyalty program.

If you pay for food via YoYo, you will receive points which can be redeemed to get (for example) fruit, chocolate bars or even a smoothie depending on how many points you have.

Additionally, there are loyalty cards on the app, so, for example, your 10th hot drink might be free.
