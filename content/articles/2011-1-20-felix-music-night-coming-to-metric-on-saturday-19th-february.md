Students of Imperial College, UNITE! Sorry, I’ve always wanted to say that.

We’re throwing a party at Imperial College’s very own Union live music venue and all around super-club, Metric, on Saturday 19th February. It will feature a showcase of Imperial’s musical talent, featuring three live bands from Jazz’ Rock Soc and three electronic acts from Music Tech, alongside a handful of DJs.

It will be a celebration of our local musical scene, where young men and women are balancing their degrees with providing balls awesome on-stage entertainment. A golden opportunity to bond with other music-lovers, share a drink and make new acquaintances. There’ll be laughter, there’ll be music, and most importantly there’ll be you, my friend. Along with all my other friends, and all your other friends.

Since its refurbishment, Imperial’s live venue Metric has become an amazing venue, that we believe could easily rival with clubs like Fabric, except with much, much cheaper drinks. However to make the most of these awesome resources at our disposal, we think it’s cooler to let Imperial’s own budding artists perform there for you. This is why we are inviting you to come check out 19.02, the first Felix Music Night.

We have some great performances lined up for you, and with the variety of acts on the bill we can guarantee there will be at least one group that will tickle your fancy.

Over the next four issues we’ll be presenting the people who will be performing at 19.02 and reviewing some of their performances around London as we build up to the event. We begin next week with an interview of alt-rockers The Vetoes, the night’s headliners.

So keep checking the Music pages, and look out for the nifty posters around campus, featuring a sick design by Luke Tomlin.
