Monday 25th February marked the start of ‘Believe and Do Good’ (BADG) 2019. BADG is a campaign where Muslim Medics and Imperial Islamic Society collaborate to dedicate a week to doing good to our local community. Inspired by a verse from the Quran: "Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds - they will have the Gardens of Paradise as a lodging" [107 - Al-Kahf], our volunteers set out to make a difference in the community.

We started off with our exclusive BADG styled Shake Break, where the line-up of amazing events were launched (and we all enjoyed some delicious takeaway and cake!) We heard from the Heads of each event, and the buildup of hype began! We couldn’t wait to get see what amazing opportunities BADG would bring.

The week kicked off with a stall in the Sir Alexander Fleming Building. Students and staff alike were encouraged to pledge a small creative act of kindness, such as brightening up someone’s day. They were given a certificate and a goody bag too!

On Tuesday, a group of eager medical students brought sweet treats and friendly faces to elderly patients at Charing Cross Hospital. The patients were delighted to have visitors and engaged in joyful conversation.

The next day consisted of something a little different. Enthusiastic students got stuck in (literally!) and worked together to clean up a community garden in Chelsea.

On Thursday, an altruistic group of students donated blood at a nearby blood donation centre. There was also a stall in the Sir Alexander Fleming Building to encourage signups. It was lovely to see so much involvement from students, especially as blood donation has the potential to make a great difference to those in need.

Next up, Saturday brought a first-term event for Imperial BADG. Medical students delivered a talk about diabetes and health awareness, in an effort to increase knowledge about common diseases in our community. The attendees benefited greatly, from receiving blood pressure checks and information (with some of them even making notes!).

And last but certainly not least, Sunday saw our first ever Homeless Drive in collaboration with KCL and LSE. Hygiene packs as well as food and essential items were distributed to those in need in Holborn. It was amazing to see our volunteers getting involved with the homeless.

Taking part in BADG always serves as a good reminder that outside of the bubble of our own lives, there are local communities and groups of people that can often use our help. Too often we become focused on how we can make massive changes to the world and solve the big issues; and in the process we forget about the little things around us. 

We would like to thank everyone who got involved, be it from pledging a creative act of kindness at the stalls, creating hygiene packs to distribute to the homeless, or simply spreading the word about this campaign. 

We couldn’t have done it without you, and we look forward to further opportunities to serve our community together.
