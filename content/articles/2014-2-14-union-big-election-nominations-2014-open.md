The nominations for the Union’s Big Elections 2014 opened this Monday. These elections determine who will fill key roles at the Union during the 2014-15 academic year.

The roles being contested include 7 full-time roles (Union President, the Union Deputy Presidents, the ICSMSU President and the Felix Editor), Student Trustees, Council Chair, Liberation officers, positions on Constituent Union Committees and postitions within departments.

All full members of the Union are eligible to stand and vote, however if a student wishes to stand they need to complete the nominations process outlined on the Union website before nominations close on Sunday, 2 March at 23:59.

Voting then opens for a week from Friday, 7 March at noon until noon on Friday, 14 March, after which results will be published and broadcast live.
