__In London__

[London Literature Festival](http://ticketing.southbankcentre.co.uk/find/festivals-series/london-literature-festival)

30 June – 14 July

Southbank’s annual summer literary festival brings together some of the best homegrown talent, a large repertoire of worldwide literature, fresh pieces from young and emerging authors, and a dash of alternative literature; so whatever your tastes are, you are bound to find something there. This year’s festival features Philip Pullman, Hanif Kureishi, Alan Hollinghurst, Elif Shafak, Michael Morpurgo and many more. Book early for popular events.

[World Literature Weekend](http://www.lrbshop.co.uk/pages.php?pageid=66)

17 June – 19 June

A relatively new festival that celebrates foreign literature. Only in its third year, luminaries speaking at the weekend include A.S. Byatt and Ramsey Nasr, Poet Laureate of the Netherlands. This year’s theme is ‘history and its traces in the present’. There will be some spotlight on crime fiction as well. Literary translation plays a big role in this festival and if you dare, try on the tranlation masterclasses.

__Outside London__

[Hay Festival of Literature and Arts](http://www.hayfestival.com/portal/index.aspx?skinid=1&localesetting=en-GB)

26 May – 5 June

Held annually at Hay-On-Wye, a small Welsh town famed for second-hand and antique book stores, the festival was hailed as the “Woodstock of the mind” by Bill Clinton. The Hay Festival is not just a literary festival: it is a celebration of ideas. Featuring a diverse range of speakers from authors (duh!), playwrights, philosphers, and journalists to scientists, economists, musicians and comedians. Many prominent figures have graced the Hay Festival’s stage, and this year is no exception.

15 September – 18 September

Another young festival, it has grown at an astonishing rate as it’s organized by The Independent. Last year’s speakers included Richard Dawkins, Philip Pullman, Matt Ridley and many more. Held at Blenheim Palace, the location itself warrants a visit. With 2100 acres of parkland, lush gardens, a large lake and baroque architechture, it’s the perfect summer getaway. Not to mention it’s also the birthplace of Winston Churchill and a World Heritage Site.

[Edinburgh International Book Festival](http://www.edbookfest.co.uk/)

13 August – 29 August

With over 700 events and 220,000 visitors, this must be one of the biggest literary festivals around. It features a series of high profile debates and discussions, and plenty of meet the authors sessions. Established and new authors roam the festival in large numbers. Two independent bookstores are set up for the festival as well. Guo Heng Chin
