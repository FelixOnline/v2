The Swimming and Water Polo Club is looking forward to a crucial term, with both the Men’s and Women’s Water Polo teams keen to secure some wins after difficult spells last term. The Men’s team has its first challenge of the New Year on Saturday as they face the University of the West of England at home. The match promises to be a physical one, but the team will have to make their superior speed and skill count against the brute force of UWE. The Women’s team will have to wait longer to kick-start their 2018, as they play Exeter at home on 27th January. They will be keen to exact their revenge after losing the away fixture dramatically, in a game which saw Maria Medeiros heroically play the second half with what later turned out to be a dislocated shoulder.

The Swimming team is gearing up to host teams from across London in the next round of the London Swimming League at Ethos on the afternoon of Saturday 3rd February. The previous round at UCL saw fantastic IC participation, with many swimmers entering their first ever swimming competition. It also saw, rather predictably, UCL forget to bring along diving blocks, adding that little bit extra to everybody’s times. Feel free to come along to support at Ethos, or join at the after party in Metric where drink tokens will be just £2.50. 

Before then, anyone struggling to lose those festive pounds is welcome to try any of the range of activities we offer. If you’d like to swim, come to the pool in Ethos on Wednesdays 2.00pm to 3.30pm, where you can expect a coached, fitness-based session in a friendly group. For the extra keen, land training is on just before this at 1.00pm on the first floor of the Union Building. This intense workout consists of a variety of bodyweight exercises and is run by the charismatic and undeniably charming Andrew Duckworth. If you’re up for trying something new, water polo might just be for you. Great fun and a real whole body workout, our sessions are structured by our coach Adam (Last year’s Sport Imperial Coach of the Year) or one of our experienced players. They take place on Monday’s and Friday’s from 8.45pm to 10.00pm, also in Ethos. To find out more about what we have to offer, you can find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, or our website.

Come along, you might just love it!
