David Ropeik tackles a subject that both fascinates and bewilders us, taking apart the human psyche to try and explain why it is that we fear the things we do, however irrational those fears are. He separates the risks associated with common fears such as snakes from long-term risks which in the end are the ones that we are not instinctively able to deal with. Ropeik explains both the mental process that has made fear a fundamental part of our evolution and the rational approach we have developed in dealing with risks over time.

There is a distinct comparison that Ropeik seems to be trying to make between the modern iPhone wielding man and his cave-dwelling ancestors; he is willing us to reassess what we are actually afraid of and the quantitative risks involved. This is an interesting and well written book, although not as exciting as I had hoped, it was a refreshing outlook on modern life.
