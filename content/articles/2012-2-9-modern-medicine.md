You might not immediately assume DNA sequencing technology and human medicine go hand in hand, but you’d be wrong. Research currently being carried out by scientists involved in the [Human Genome Project](http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/home.shtml) is having a huge impact on 21st century medicine.

In a lecture on February 2, organised by the [Friends of Imperial College](http://www.friendsofimperial.org.uk), Imperial [Professor Timothy Aitman](http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/people/t.aitman/) talked about human genomics and its influence on 21st century medicine. The professor, currently a member of quango ‘the [Human Genetics Commission](http://www.hgc.gov.uk/Client/index.asp?ContentId=1)’, discussed the advances made in the identification of genes involved in both rare and common genetic disorders, as well as a brief history of how geneticists have gotten to where they are today. Professor Aitman claimed that “the tipping point is very close now,” in reference to the fact that genome sequencing is now so cheap that the ‘thousand-dollar genome’ is likely to be made possible by the end of 2012, if not sooner. He spoke only briefly about the ethical issues that surround genetic testing, though with only an hour at his disposal the professor was hard-pressed to do anything more than scratch the surface of the vast topic.

Professor Aitman spoke both enthusiastically and knowledgeably over the course of his hour-long talk. He explained otherwise complicated technologies very succinctly and presented information in a clear, concise way that did not leave people with limited biochemical knowledge in the dark.

Though this member of the audience is well acquainted with the biochemical principles underlying DNA sequencing and the [Human Genome Project](http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/home.shtml) it was nevertheless a very engaging talk that prompted one to think about both the near and far-future. Professor Aitman neatly brought together scientific research and its practical applications in personalised drug therapy and preventative medicine. Whilst ethical issues must be faced it is clear that 21st century medicine has a bright future ahead of it.
 The Friends of Imperial College is dedicated to spreading enthusiasm and knowledge of science, technology and medicine. It is independent of, but linked to, one of the premier scientific establishments on the globe and organises lectures and events to spread knowledge and stimulate attention to up-and-coming scientific developments.
