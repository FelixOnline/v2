A low drone sounds. “Dadddy, daddy, please don’t kill me.” Children begin to sing and a great machine starts up. “Daddy! Daddy!”… You awake in your bed, and go off in search of your children.
 Thus begins the 5-6 hour horror experience that is Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, an indirect sequel to Frictional Games The Dark Descent. After a short period in which you learn the games only controls; crouching, picking up items, opening doors and running (which you will do if crouching fails), you are immediately thrust into a world of terror. Unlike the original this game is developed by The Chinese Room (who previously did Dear Esther). This is probably responsible for the difference between the two games. Many of my favourite game mechanics from the original are not present in the new one. Even mechanics that I thought made The Dark Descent the great game it is! A Machine for Pigs offers very little in terms of puzzles and gameplay. Gone are The Dark Descent days of having to light candles, and fill up your lantern to keep your sanity levels up. Your inventory is gone, and now you must carry around various items much like you would in Portal. You can even use your lantern as much as you want without worrying about it running out (although you will want to turn it off nearly as much as you want it on!) A Machine for Pigs does not satisfy my needs for another The Dark Descent, but it does provide a gripping interactive horror story that will keep you entertained, terrified and, at times, a little disgusted.
 This game handles very smoothly, which is important for a game that relies almost solely on you experiencing the world. Everything from opening doors, to turning wheels and picking up fuses feels intuitive and simple. There is even has controller support should you want to use it. The world is as beautiful as it is horrifying which keeps you immersed and keeps you with a feeling of unease. Not once in this game did I feel safe. I was always expecting things to jump out at me but was never ready for them when they did. You will jump and more than once! Nearly everything about this game is terrifying, down to the amazing music which suited the game perfectly. From creepy orchestral music, to children singing nursery rhymes, the organ in the chapel and the sounds of the great machine (which you spend most of the game interacting with), it all adds to the experience. Throughout the game you travel through many locations; your house, the attic, the roads of Victorian London, and then the meat processing factory that hides a terrible secret as you descend into it and come to meet the machine. The story is told through voice acting, which is superb, and hidden diary entries which slowly illuminate you to the terrible things you’ve done but can’t remember…
 A Machine for Pigs is a very story driven game. None of it is particularly hard gameplay wise, but when you are scared it’s very easy to panic and make mistakes. The story is excellent and alone is enough to make you want to play on despite the challenge. For one play through the price of £12.99 is good, although I’m sure most people will play through it more than once which makes the price even better. I would get this game if you are a fan of horror, and like the idea of an interactive terrifying experience. From a gameplay point of view, this game isn’t challenging at all. If you are looking for a challenge I would recommend the original, which also has user made stories and the mini expansion Justine.
