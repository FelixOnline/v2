Liverpool saw their Champions League dreams end with a 1-1 draw against Basel. Brendan Rodgers’ team needed to win to qualify, but will instead have to settle with the Europa League. Arsenal, who had already qualified, thumped Galatasaray 4-1, with Aaron Ramsey scoring an early contender for goal of the season. Manchester City qualified as well, courtesy of a 2-0 win in Rome.

Jenson Button has been awarded a new contract at McLaren. He will partner Fernando Alonso next season while Kevin Magnussen will be the team’s reserve driver.

England batsman Craig Kieswetter looks set to miss the 2015 season after suffering a setback from the eye injury that he suffered in July. In the first Australian match since Phillip Hughes’ death, Michael Clarke, David Warner and Steve Smith (all former team mates of Hughes at New South Wales) scored hundreds as Australia dominated the first two days against India. On the third day Indian captain Virat Kohli was hit flush on the helmet by a bouncer from Mitchell Johnson. He recovered to score a hundred as India mounted a comeback on day three.

In his first competitive tournament after a four-month lay-off from injury, Tiger Woods finished in a tie for last place. Jordan Spieth won by 10 shots.

A German TV documentary has alleged that 99% of Russian athletes are guilty of doping. It has also since alleged that at least one Briton has avoided an inquiry, after 150 samples, marked as “highly suspicious”, were not investigated.
