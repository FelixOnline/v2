Imperial has unveiled a new pilot scheme for undergraduates, which aims to challenge students to consider global issues through use of their scientific knowledge.

The new initiative, entitled [Imperial Horizons](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/horizons), is being led by the materials physicist [Professor Adrian Sutton](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.sutton).

The free programme consists of eight weekly two hour sessions on Monday evenings on the South Kensington campus, with students attending lectures delivered by Imperial research stars as well as outside speakers from the worlds of science, media and policy, allowing for further interaction with the world of research.

Professor Sutton has explained the purpose of the scheme as a means to enable students to put their degrees in a broader context: “Undergraduates at Imperial receive one of the most thorough technical educations available world-wide but there is a growing sense that the education we provide has become too narrow, that we don’t facilitate students from different faculties working together and learning about each other’s ways of thinking.”

“I believe that Imperial College is exceptionally well placed to deliver this programme. This is partly because the College has a long tradition of innovation in teaching and of recognizing excellence in teaching.”

The course begins on January 23. Students can sign up through the website [www3.imperial.ac.uk/horizons](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/horizons).
