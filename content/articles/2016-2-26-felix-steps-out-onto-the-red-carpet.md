Best Picture

All signs point to this going to_The Revenant_, and it’s a pity really. I found it perhaps one of the dullest, uninspiring, hollow films I’ve seen in recent memory; while in the cinema it may seem like a real journey, but looking back you are hit with the realisation that the film actually says nothing of interest or note. _Spotlight_ could be a dark horse, as could _The Big Short_, but really I feel like the award would serve the film community best by going to _Mad Max: Fury Road_. An inventive, high-octane, perfectly-balanced film, _Fury Road_ creates a world filled with improbable characters and highly-detailed ecosystems and after the credits roll you wish you could stay longer – surely the mark of a great film. It would also help break the drama homogeny that has consumed the Academy, showing us that an action film can still have great merit.

Will Win: _The Revenant_
Should Win: _Mad Max: Fury Road_

Best Director

It looks like Iñaritu will win this award for the second year in the row for his work behind the camera in _The Revenant_. Really it would be no surprise: Academy voters enjoy it when things are spelled out for them, and _The Revenant_ is so stuffed full of technically impressive shots that voters can sleep easy knowing there is indeed someone giving the film direction. However, I prefer those whose work is a little less obvious; I think it takes much more skill to create a tightly controlled drama, and (glossing over the outrage that Todd Haynes wasn’t nominated) therefore I think the award should go to Lenny Abrahamson. Not only does he delicately handle the brutal subject matter of sexual abuse story _Room_, but he also ekes out two of the most genuine performances in recent years, from Brie Larson as Ma, and the stunning, revolutionary Jacob Tremblay as Jack.

Will Win: _Alejandro G. Iñárritu (The Revenant)_
Should Win: _Lenny Abrahamson (Room)_

Best Actor

God, this is a bad year for actors. Following on from his win last year, Eddie Redmayne put in an offensively affected performance in _The Danish Girl_, meaning real-life trans pioneer Lili Elbe had no resemblance to any human being I have ever met. Similarly, Bryan Cranston portrayed Dalton Trumbo as a collection of bizarre tics given human form, using a voice that suggested toothache. Matt Damon was adequate in _The Martian_, but for a film that is basically centred completely around him, he made very little impact. I haven’t seen _Steve Jobs_, so I can’t comment on Michael Fassbender, but I don’t know if it could be worse than the others. All signs point to this award going to Leonardo DiCaprio for his role as grizzled survivalist Hugh Glass, showing that to win an award you don’t need to show nuance or skill, just a willingness to grunt a lot and eat bear liver on screen.

Will Win: _Leonardo DiCaprio (The Revenant)_
Should Win: _Nobody_

Best Actress

In direct contrast to the offerings on display in the Best Actor category, I can’t remember a year when the Best Actress race has been stuffed with such fantastic performances. Out in front for me are Charlotte Rampling, for her devastating turn in _45 Years_, Cate Blanchett, who formed the foundation of _Carol_, and Brie Larson, for her stunningly affecting performance as abuse survivor in _Room_. While Saoirse Ronan was charming in _Brooklyn_, and J-Law was bolshie in _Joy_, neither of them can match the others in terms of the power of their performance. Smart money is on Larson to win on the night, and though I will be happy for her, deep down I feel Blanchett outstripped all competition with her nuanced, controlled performance as Carol Aird.

Will Win: _Brie Laron (Room)_
Should Win: _Cate Blanchett (Carol)_

Best Supporting Actor

Maybe it’s the theatre snob in me, but I would love it if Mark Rylance takes home the award. Legendary for his theatre work, not least as artistic director of The Globe, Rylance’s performance in _Bridge of Spies_ is magnificent, and recognition would show the worlds of film and theatre are not as distinct as people think. As Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, Rylance brings a sense of deadpan humour in his controlled performance, and is the best thing in _Bridge of Spies_. I don’t think Tom Hardy’s performance in _The Revenant_ was worth shouting about, and similarly Christian Bale’s nomination for his blunt treatment of hedge funder Michael Burry is baffling. Mark Ruffalo could be a possibility, given his outburst of energy in _Spotlight_, but ultimately I think Sylvester Stallone will nab it, less for his turn in _Creed_, but more for recognition of his decades of work.

Will Win: _Sylvester Stallone (Creed)_
Should Win: _Mark Rylance (Bridge of Spies_

Best Supporting Actress

Bookies have Kate Winslet down as the likely winner, following her performance in Danny Boyle’s _Steve Jobs_, during which – dodgy Polish accent aside – she showed off her powerful expressiveness. The dark horse of the race could be Alicia Vikander, who acted Eddie Redmayne into a corner in _The Danish Girl._ Jennifer Jason Leigh is unlikely to get the nod, although _The Hateful Eight_ marks a welcome resurgence in her career. Similarly, Rachel McAdams was possibly the best actor in _Spotlight_, but probably won’t hold up to the others. For me, Rooney Mara deserves to take home the award for creating the complex, emotionally-layered Therese Belivet in _Carol_; unfortunately, that role lacked bombastic moments or hysterical outbursts, and therefore will be overlooked by the Academy.

Will Win: _Kate Winslet (Steve Jobs)_
Should Win: _Rooney Mara (Carol)_

Best Original Screnplay

Out of the five nominees for this award, only two have come up with truly inventive ideas: _Ex Machina_ and _Inside Out_ both tell completely original tales, one looking to our childhood past, the other to a potential future. The others all take on real-life happenings: Cold War counter-intelligence swapping in _Bridge of Spies_; the Catholic church molestation scandal in _Spotlight_; and the rise and fall of N.W.A. in _Straight Outta Compton_. However, while it is tricky creating something out of nothing, it is arguably more difficult to tackle a historical event and afford it the required gravitas and respect. This is exactly what Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer have done with _Spotlight_, which manages to present an immensely complex and controversial topic without a sense of dumbing things down for the audience.

Will Win: _Tom McCarthy &amp; Josh Singer (Spotlight)_
Should Win: _Tom McCarthy &amp; Josh Singer (Spotlight)_

Best Adapted Screenplay

Pity the voters for this award; few Academy voters actually watch the films nominated, let alone go through the hassle of reading the books they were based on, and this means that the skill of many brilliant screenwriters has not been recognised. Out of the last five awards, four have gone to films based on non-fiction books, perhaps reflecting the difficulty tackling such subject matter can pose when compared to pieces of fiction. As such, it is likely that _The Big Short_ will win, and while the screenwriters’ effort to make such an elephantine topic as the housing collapse accessible in an 120-minute film is admirable, I would love to see the award go to Phyllis Nagy for her pitch-perfect adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s _The Price of Salt_, which retains all the brittle sharpness of the original text, and is the most faithful adaptation I have possibly ever seen.

Will Win: _Adam McKay and Charles Randolph (The Big Short)_
Should Win: _Phyllis Nagy (Carol)_

Best Documentary

I know people say let bygones be bygones, but I can’t help feel that this year’s award should go to _The Look of Silence_, if only to compensate director Daniel Oppenheimer for the fact that two years ago his absolutely mind-blowing documentary _The Act of Killing_ lost out to _20 Feet From Stardom_, a documentary about backing singers. _The Look of Silence_ may not be as powerful as his last film, but history calls for reparations. Ultimately, however, the award is likely to go to _Amy_, Asif Kapadia’s portrait of Amy Winehouse, whose descent and death is played out in graphic detail. Whilst the film relies on footage obtained by the paparazzi who arguably helped drive Winehouse to her death, and its voyeuristic feel makes you feel complicit in her addiction and downfall, _Amy_ would be a worthy winner.

Will Win: _Amy_
Should Win: _The Look of Silence_

Best Animated Feature

Now, I hear _Anomalisa_ is supposed to be brilliant. It’s not out until next month in the UK, but the buzz around it is that it’s a subtle, nuanced, beautiful piece of work – which means that it will undoubtedly lose at the Academy Awards. Luckily, it seems that the award will go to _Inside Out_, which would be a completely worthy winner. Taking a look at the interior life of a child going through a rough patch, _Inside Out_ connects us with our childhood memories, managing to communicate vastly complex psychological and emotional concepts with an ease that belies its ingenuity. _Inside Out_ marks perhaps a return to form for Pixar, which is joyful news in and of itself. Oh, and it made me weep like a baby 10,000 feet above the Atlantic, glass of plane wine clutched in my hand. Make of that what you will.

Will Win: _Inside Out_
Should Win: _Inside Out_

Best Original Score

All signs point towards Ennio Morricone winning this for his scoring of Tarantino’s Western _The Hateful Eight_, and why not – it’s a wonderful piece of work, managing to be stirring, exciting, but never overbearing. You might accuse Morricone of ripping off tropes of Western music, but he pretty much invented them. _Star Wars_ has its usual John Williams treatment, but does he really need a sixth Oscar? You’re getting greedy John. Similarly, _Bridge of Spies_ has a perfectly perfunctory score from Thomas Newman, all swelling strings, but any Cold War film that doesn’t make use of Nena’s ‘99 Luftballons’ is dead to me (I know it was set decades before Nena released this banger, but really, does that matter? No. The answer’s no.) However, _Carol_-lover that I am, I would love for this to go to Carter Burwell, for his delicate compositions, which complement the tightly controlled drama.

Will Win: _Ennio Morricone (The Hateful Eight)_
Should Win: _Carter Burwell (Carol)_

Best Cinematography

Acinematographer can make or break a film – and yet the role is often overlooked by cinema-goers. This year the award will inevitably go to Emmanuel Lubezki for the third year in a row, for _The Revenant_ – it’s probably fair, since the scenic shots are by far the best thing in the film. Vittorio Storaro does equally good work in _The Hateful Eight_, although the interior shots means he can’t show off his chops; and in _Mad Max_ John Seale takes us through the entire colour spectrum, from blistering reds to cooling blues. However, I think shooting a beautiful film is easier when you already have natural beauty in front of you; it takes something more to take a city street, and capture the urban magic through the grime. And that’s why I think Edward Lachman should win, for his sensuous portrayal of NYC, heavily influenced by Saul Leiter’s masterful photography.

Will Win: _Emmanuel Lubezki (The Revenant)_
Should Win: _Edward Lachman (Carol)_
