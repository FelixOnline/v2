__Grave Encounters 2 __- _OUT NOW_

Grave Encounters was a found-footage horror phenomenon that many people believed was just a movie. But in Grave Encounters 2, film student Alex Wright is out to prove the disbelievers wrong. Alex is as obsessed with the first film as the 20 million people who viewed its viral trailer on YouTube. While he and his friends research the events and visit the real psychiatric hospital depicted in the original film, they find themselves face-to-face with unspeakable evil – and have hope that their knowledge of the original film will help them survive the sequel.

__Frankenweenie__ - _OUT NOW_

A stop-motion, animated film, Frankenweenie was filmed in black and white and rendered in 3D, which enhances the old-fashioned style to a whole new experience. From the never-ending genius of Tim Burton comes Frankenweenie, a heartwarming tale about a boy and his dog (that doesn’t star Johnny Depp). After unexpectedly losing his beloved dog Sparky, young Victor Frankenstein uses the power of science to bring back his best canine friend – albeit with a few minor adjustments. Although Victor attempts to conceal his dodgy doggy, the new Sparky escapes the confines of his attic, and the entire town learns about this new way of creating life – and decided that it was potentially monstrous.

__Paranormal Activity 4 __- _19/10/12_

Set in 2011, five years since the goings-on of Paranormal Activity, this new twisted tale follows the life of teenager Alice and her family – a nice suburban bunch who happen to be the new neighbours of a returning Katie (who, if you’ll recall, killed her boyfriend Micah, sister Kristi, and her brother-in-law Daniel in the first film) and her kidnapped baby Hunter (now named Robbie for some weird reason). Funnily enough, the same weird stuff that happened in the first, second and third films kicks off all over again.

__Sinister __- _OUT NOW_

Struggling true-crime novelist Ellison stumbles into a supernatural mystery that threatens the lives of his entire family in this nightmarish horror story. Seeking inspiration for his latest book, Ellison (foolishly) moves his wife and children into a home where a family perished under rather nasty circumstances. Terror soon hits home when he discovers a box of old movies in the attic of the house, and finds to his horror images of various families being murdered. The deeper Ellison investigates, the more he fears he has stirred an evil that won’t rest until it has claimed his entire family.
