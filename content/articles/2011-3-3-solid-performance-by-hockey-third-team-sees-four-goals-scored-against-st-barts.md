The Men’s 3’s overcame the odds to produce a sterling performance to embarrass St Bart’s 2s. Quick play mixed with characteristic flair saw the 3s put 4 past a solid Bart’s team.

After horrendous traffic, the men’s 3s arrived five minutes after the scheduled push off, meaning the first 11 on the pitch were the starting XI. None the less IC were energetic and their tenacity paid off with an early goal Designer V powering in from the top of the D.

Nerves were settled and IC settled into a good rhythm, now with their original starting XI on the pitch, Cockerel scored a fantastic solo goal. The goal was good but the celebration was pure arrogance.

However Bart’s didn’t give up fighting, a surging foray into the IC half led to a brave one on one save from Sifter. The loose ball was crossed in from the edge of the D and a moment of madness from Fritzl saw him smashing the ball into his own goal. IC’s response was instant, from the push off IC drove forward, the ball found Teabag who slammed the goal past the despairing dive of the Bart’s GK.

In the second half IC turned the match into a training game knocking the ball around with ease. Any time Bart’s got a stick on the ball, IC won it back. Simple hockey resulted in IC scoring their 4th after Designer V found himself with lots of space in the D to calmly slap the ball home to complete his brace and IC’s rout. The final whistle came as a blessed relief to the Bart’s team allowing IC a long but joyful journey home which, due to unfortunate circumstances, was not remembered by anyone.
