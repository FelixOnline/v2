This week College took another step in the right direction on the journey of animal research by signing the Concordat on Animal Research, a document that promises transparency and openness about animal experimentation. College is trying to shed the murky allegations raised by the BUAV (British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection) last year during an undercover operation that lead to scrutiny by the national press and former alumni.

While College has made progress, having commissioned an independent report and acted on its findings, there will still be someway to go before suspicions are fully alleviated.

Last weekend the Imperial Festival took over campus in all of its marquee glory, with students and staff coming together to help explain science to the general public. As it turns out science can be confusing, even we were confused sometimes, although it was amazing to discover all the cool things going on at Imperial, a lot of which you don’t get to see during the course of your undergraduate degree. And the children, so many children; they can remind one of the childlike curiosity inside those of us who really enjoy their craft, discovering new areas of knowledge with wonder!

This week was also the week of student experience, with stories appearing about the effectiveness of current accepted teaching methods, the publication of the results from the Times Higher Education Student Experience Survey, as well as some reports in national media suggesting that one-in-five students are unhappy with the standards of teaching at their university. With all this in mind, when the Imperial survey and feedback season starts (if it hasn’t already) don’t forget that it gives you a chance to have your opinions heard (albeit in the form of what you agree or disagree with most, or hold no strong opinion on – there must be another way).

Finally, 22 May approaches, and with it the party election broadcasts, as each side tries to tell you why you should vote them into seats at the European Parliament. Don’t forget to have your say!
