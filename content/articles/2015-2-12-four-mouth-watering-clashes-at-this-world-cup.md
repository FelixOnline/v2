#### Australia v England

Melbourne Cricket Ground, 14th February

The first game in Australia in the tournament is one of the biggest there can be. Both sides will be looking to make an early statement to their group about what to expect.

#### India v Pakistan

Adelaide Oval, 15th February

The opening weekend ends with the biggest clash of them all. India haven’t lost to Pakistan in a World Cup before, but Pakistan will know that India have never looked so vulnerable going into a World Cup.

Melbourne Cricket Ground, 22th February
