One of Imperial’s very own professors has been appointed editor of a newly formed journal, _Science Robotics_, which is due to launch in July of this year.

Professor Yang is currently the Director of the Hamlyn Centre on the South Kensington campus, which specialises in research on new sensing techniques, medical imaging and medical robotics in partnership with the Surgical Innovation Centre at St Mary’s hospital.

As well as this, Professor Yang was in the The Times’ Eureka ‘Top 100’ scientists in 2010, he’s a Royal Academy of Engineering Fellow and has previously won the Royal Society Research Merit Award.

The Professor told Imperial, “The time is right for robotics to be covered by a top-tier journal from Science”.

“In my role as Editor of Science Robotics I look forward to working with the editorial board and receiving submissions from the global robotics community in all its diversity, and playing a part in sharing the most promising breakthroughs in the field.”

Professor Yang also said that his field was an expanding one, and that  it is expected to “grow exponentially over the coming years”.

The new journal will be published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, along with another new journal: _Science Immunology_.

Both journals are expected to publish 150 articles online per year.
