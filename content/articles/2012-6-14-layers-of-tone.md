A revival of what once was
 A simple concept of black and white.
 One that was with no out, now
 barely suckled by fading shadows.

The intention, to replicate fame
 Leads,
 To this insane journey
 Of delayed steps and off beats.

And looking down upon this pool
 That has yet to be made.
 A reflection of moments that
 Bare, no blame.

These simple imprints,
 Appear, more complex in the sand.
 And if the single path should bend
 That life in ink forever ends.
