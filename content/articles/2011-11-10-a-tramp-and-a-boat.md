Any of you who read my article last week probably came to the conclusion that I’m either a dribbling moron or an actual full-on nutter. For that exact reason, I’ve decided to simmer things down a bit and tell you about possibly the most peaceful thing I can imagine: an all acoustic gig on a boat gently rocking on the Thames.

This was a strange experience for me, not only because [it was on a boat](http://www.tamesis dock.co.uk) but because normally acoustic music isn’t something I buy into. I usually find it’s something I want to hear so little that if it ever comes on I wish my head would literally just be engulfed. This was different.

First on was [Tangled Hair](http://tangledhair.bandcamp.com/). Usually a three-piece, this time frontman Alan Welsh dropped his band-mates for a solo performance.

Despite complaining of a sore throat, he did an amazing job delivering his unique style of light-hearted rhythmic indie math-pop with soft melodic vocals as brilliant as ever. Initially apprehensive of whether the music would work acoustically after being so mesmerised by the full band, I was pleasantly surprised at how well Welsh conveyed the songs with just an old guitar and his vocal chords.

> The tramp began to serenade us, but not in the usual tramp style.

Welsh finished up and put down the guitar. A tramp then strolled through the crowd and approached the microphone. The tramp began to serenade us but not in the usual tramp style (substituting a guitar for an old, smashed-in piece of wood). This was an actual, real-life, not-mentally-disturbing tramp.

Something wasn’t right – there’s no such thing as an undisturbing tramp serenade. Then, through the mass of facial hair, I realised this was no vagrant, it was of course Tobias Hayes of [Shoes And Socks Off](http://www.myspace.com/search/Music?q=Shoes%20And%20Socks%20Off).

A truly inspirational musician, he was a perfect follow up to Tangled Hair with his “stubbed-toe blues”. His songs, depressing yet addictive, are so well-written that its hard to not be in awe as you watch this unassuming hero.

Finally, [Dad Rocks!](http://dadrocks.tumblr.com/) came onstage. The beer/boat combo had taken its toll on me but when he started playing, everything fell into place. By far one of the best guitar players I’ve ever seen, it felt cruel that someone with so much talent isn’t reaping the benefits that the music industry can bring. He has this incredible ability to make you feel happy with his music and his peaceful indie sound is hard to not fall in love with, especially when seen live.

Oh yeah and did I mention it was on an actual fucking boat?!?!?… Mental.

This gig really was something special and a testament to the incredible shows you can go to in London. All of the acts are on [Big Scary Monsters](http://www.bsmrocks.com) records, go check them out.
