## What it does
Ketamine, put simply, is a general anaesthetic. Whilst infrequently administered to humans, it is more commonly used when operating on animals, predominantly horses. That’s right boys and girls, sniffing Ketamine is not dissimilar to taking the drugs required to sedate a horse.

The effects don’t last long, normally 30 to 50 minutes depending on the strength and quality of the drug. Effects include; a reduction in senses likened to drunkenness, a change in perception of your sight and hearing (more commonly called ‘tripping’) and the loss of the ability to speak in a manner which others humans can understand.
## How you use it
Ketamine comes in the form of a crystalline powder. When doing research for this article, it was also suggested to me it is possible to inject, however I have never seen nor heard of this happening in real life. When sniffing any form of drug, the effects are almost instantaneous.

When sniffing, please ensure all crystals are crushed. This will not only ensure that your nose doesn’t encounter searing pain this Friday, but will also relieve you of the torment of pissing out crystals. The pain which is only comparable to that feeling encountered when you realise Trump has won the election.
## Legality
“On June 10th 2014, Ketamine changed from a class C to a class B controlled drug. This means that possession of Ketamine could now get you up to five years in jail and an unlimited fine, while supplying Ketamine to someone else could get you up to 14 years in jail and an unlimited fine.” This is official government policy. However, in real life, if caught with Ketamine for the first time you are more likely to simply receive a caution (or a reprimand if you’re under 18). Something akin to a slap on the wrist from the police.

## Some statistics
According to Home Office’s “Drug Misuse: Findings from the 2014/15 Crime Survey for England and Wales – Second edition” (doesn’t it have a fancy name for something so dull?), Ketamine use amongst 16 to 24 years olds is decreasing. With “Proportion of adults (16 – 24) reporting use” standing at 1.6%. Whilst that may appear paltry I’d wager there’s a substantial number out there not reporting use – I mean why would you?
## Things to do when you’re high
## Do
 - Chill out with your friends and watch a film, although no horrors if you’re tripping!
 - Embrace the effects – don’t worry, you’ll be fine in an hour.
 - Make sure you’re in an environment you’re comfortable with.
## Don’t
 - Feel peer pressured – if you don’t want it, DON’T DO IT!
 - Take with an upper (Cocaine, MDMA etc.) unless you know what you’re doing. Speedballing anyone?
 - Take before any important task. I shit you not, I knew someone who went to an interview after taking ketamine. Needless to say they didn’t get the job.
