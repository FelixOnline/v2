This afternoon the students standing in this year’s Big Elections were revealed, and we’ve listed who is running for what below.

553 students are running for the various roles this year; 70 more than last year. This year there are fewer students running for sabbatical positions.

Last year 16 students ran for the sabbatical roles (President, the Deputy Presidents, Felix Editor and the School of Medicine Student Union President); this year there are 14, and ICSMSU President, Felix Editor and Deputy President (Education) are uncontested.

One Sabbatical officer is re-running this year: Chris Kaye, Deputy President (Welfare) is running for Deputy President (Finance and Services).

There are three Presidential Candidates this year. Lucinda Jane Sandon-Allum, a third year biologist and current Vice President (Activities) of the Royal College of Science Union (RCSU) is running for the position. Luke Armitage, a fourth year Mathematics student and captain of the ICURFC 3RD XV Rugby team is also going to the top spot. Raven Connelly Beng Hung, a first year life sciences student pulled out of the presidential race yesterday afternoon.

The manifestos for the candidates will be appearing online this evening, and a full list of all the candidates running in the elections can be found on the Union’s Website.
