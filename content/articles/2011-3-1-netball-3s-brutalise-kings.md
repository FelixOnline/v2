With two players returning to the team, the 3’s were excited to be playing as a full squad on Monday. The opposition was King’s 4’s, a team who we knew from past experience we could beat, however we also knew they would put up a fight. Literally.

The match started with a King’s centre pass which IC failed to over turn despite being given plenty of opportunity and the teams play was anything but tidy. Once we had reminded ourselves how to play netball we overturned the next two centres as a result of great movement down the court by centre Amelia and WA Lucie, but it quickly became apparent that King’s liked to play aggressively as GD Nakai had her glasses knocked clean from her face by the opposing captain. The rest of the King’s team followed her example and the IC girls were being beaten up all over the court. However, having decided not to retaliate, IC instead showed King’s how to play netball properly and without being called up for contact every five seconds. At the end of the first quarter IC were leading by two goals, due to some fantastic shooting by Heather and Angela, and great defence by goal keeper Fern. In the 2nd quarter, returning shooter Lucinda stepped on to the court and it was like she had never left. With quick passing around the goal third by Sarah and some excellent movement by Heather, the lead was increased to 11-6, a margin that was in no way large enough for IC to get complacent.

After a rousing team talk from captain Lucie and Becky’s claim that if we didn’t win she would have to slap the King’s centre, we returned to the court. The King’s captain had apparently given a different talk as they returned with a slightly more literal fighting spirit. IC refused to be pushed around and after Nakai “accidentally” smacked the ball into the King’s captains excuse for a face, IC were given a new lease of life, controlling the rest of the game. The final score was 40-26 with Lucinda deservedly receiving player of the match and IC’s 3’s keeping their unbeaten at home record. Let’s keep it going to Varsity
