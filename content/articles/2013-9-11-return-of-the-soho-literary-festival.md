The Soho Literary festival is to return for its third year at the Soho Theatre. Taking place at the end of this month (September 26-29) the festival is organised by _The Oldie _magazine, a publication well known for its regular literary lunches. With over thirty different events there is guaranteed to be something to appeal every lover of books and literature.

Highlights include historian Dan Snow's talk on the history of Syria, literary biographer and historian Richard Davenport-Hines' discussion of the Profumo Affair and illustrator Quentin Blake's exploration of "the uses of illustration". The afternoon of Sunday, September 29 will also see the return of the popular Classics Quiz, with journalists Rachel Johnson and Harry Mount leading two teams answering questions from quizmaster Professor William Fitzgerald.

For more information, and to book tickets for the individual events, see [soholitfest.com](http://www.soholitfest.com). Students may get discounted tickets for Â£6 by entering the code __SOHOLIT6 __when booking their tickets. See a full report from the festival in _Felix _on Friday, October 4.
