The unbeaten ICURFC boys proudly journeyed all the way out to North London to challenge the medics of UCL – officially the RUMS rugby club – in what was sure to be a crucial, possibly title-deciding fixture.

All was faring well on the Imperial boys’ quest to become men as Coach Rich was seen to have found his way to the correct ground for a Wednesday fixture.

Confidence was high as Ed “Paper Plane” Durkin (Captain of Morale, season 14-15) cheered on his housemate and on-field captain, James Cocks, to kick over the first three points of the game in favour of Imperial.

The early lead was well deserved but unfortunately short-lived as RUMS ran in two tries in quick succession to take a cushioned lead.

The Imperial reply was powerful with Tom Hedley scoring close to the posts to allow easy addition of the following two points.

A double interchange of scores between the two sides saw Hedley tally again and the board begin to look like a village cricket total.

26-22 to RUMS. The Imperial boys spent the first 20 minutes of the second half retaining the ball and playing the best rugby of the game but were held out by a gritty defense.

The forwards worked their way up the field with powerful breaks from Adam Postlethwaite and Joe Bowden.

Finally the ball was released to the backs to be spread wide and Fred Brown used his pace to evade his opposite number and touch down in the corner, granting the away side the lead again.

Unfortunately a two-footed challenge from the opposition landed near Freddie’s, formerly untouched and innocent, sphincter as he dived in to score resulted in a substitution of wingers to see young Carlos Sheppard take the field, all the way from British Columbia.

Ladies of Imperial you have nothing to worry about as I’m sure Mr. White, one of the founding faces of RigSoc, will not be deterred from attending ACC this coming Wednesday.

IC’s defense appeared to become more and more flimsy as RUMS put in another thirteen points to take a comfy lead.

With only minutes to go Olisa Ufodiama (certified BNOC) brushed off numerous tackles to charge up centerfield and score between the posts to narrow the margin.

Unfortunately the boys’ hopes were crushed as RUMS relentlessly scored another ten points and sealed their victory late on.

The despondent Imperial lads trudged back to South Kensington without Sylvia to drown their sorrows and begin preparations for the fixture against St. Mary’s. This game is sure to result with a victory.

Be sure to make your way through the hot gate on Wednesday 29th October to attend ACC and observe the might of the disciplined and uniform ICURFC.
