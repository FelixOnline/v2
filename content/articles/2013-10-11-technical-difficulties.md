So, we had a some perfectly timed technical difficulties this week, much like when the printer breaks down just before you’re supposed to be handing in an assignment. I’m praying that this arrives on Friday, so if you see it when you’re out getting lunch you’ll know that today is a lucky day!
 Anyhow on with the week’s news. One of the unexpected parts of the news this week is the upcoming visit to Imperial by Prince Harry, of Royal and tabloid fame. The Prince’s visit marks the opening of the Royal British Legion Centre for Blast Injury Studies, a new centre created to improve treatment and recovery for personnel serving in the military. I’m sure security will be tight but who knows, maybe he’ll stop by the new College Café for one of those handmade sandwiches? Another interesting topic is the resurgence of mascotry in the Faculty Unions, something I’ve certainly missed out on as a member of CGCU. While investigating the story, as well as interviewing the RCSU President Plabon Saba I also stumbled upon College’s blog dedicated to our collection of mascots. Hopefully after one of the mascots was taken while the person in the office was literally sleeping in the job, we might see some more mascot activities taking place of the course of the year. It will also be interesting to see what the RCSU decides to do with the violated mascot, after all the current Theta cost more than £10,000 at the time of creation. They might be forgiven for not commissioning a new version!

Felix is also starting a new feature as part of the Clubs & Socs section, a full page from a different Faculty/ Constituent Union each week, starting with the RCSU (I’ve already seen Plabon too many time this week). Hopefully you’ll be able to keep up with events and activities of your union on an almost monthly basis. We’ve also got a wide range of interesting stories
 this week, from our short snippets of higher education news (including a rather worrying call from the Oxford Vice Chancellor for even more fee increases), an interesting head-to- head about religious integration and separation in schools and an insightful features piece about studying abroad on the Erasmus scheme.

Finally, keep an eye on the Union elections happening this month. If you’d like to stand for a position you still have until Sunday to enter. As well as Year Reps and Liberation officers there are also positions available on the Union Council, a body where you really can make a difference.
