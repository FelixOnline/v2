__Gone Girl - 18:00__

_Gone Girl _is not quite the traditional murder-mystery whodunit that it seems on the surface. Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) runs a bar in a small town in Missouri and lives in a luxury house in the suburbs with his beautiful wife Amy (Rosamund Pike). Their life seems perfect on the outside but on the day of their 5 wedding anniversary, Amy disappears. Blood is left at the scene of their home and suspicions fall on Nick who seems strange and unemotional on camera but denies any wrongdoing. As the police race against time to find Amy, it soon becomes clear that something else is amiss.

__Interstellar - 21:15__

If all of your friends have been flocking to IMAX theatres, chances are there’s only one thing they’ve been seeing-Christopher Nolan’s latest film _Interstellar_! Crop blights have decimated the earth and forced regression back to an agricultural society. Former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is recruited on one final space mission to go through a wormhole so that civilization can survive on a new planet. As with all films set in space, their mission is fraught with complications not to mention the fact that due to relativity, hours in space are the same as years on earth which takes its toll on the astronauts and their relationships with their loved ones. The result is that, Interstellar is one of those rare films with spectacle and heart in equal measure.

__The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 - 00:45__

_The Hunger Games_ series continues as following on from _Catching Fire_, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and the rebels of District 13 begin to mount their rebellion against President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and the Capitol. Haunted by The Capitol’s capture of Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and her inability to do anything about this, Katniss channels her frustration into her new role as ‘the face of the rebellion’ and participates in propaganda videos denouncing Snow to try and gain support for the movement. The vindictive Snow reacts by exacting revenge on Katniss and her loved ones.

__Nightcrawler - 03:15__

In the past, Jake Gyllenhaal has been typecast as a pretty boy due to well, his dashing good lucks but after seeing _Nightcrawler _be prepared to see that categorisation well and truly subside. Gyllenhaal loses 30 lbs (mostly from his morals) to play Lou Bloom, an unemployed wannabe entrepreneur who becomes enticed by the world of LA’s nightcrawlers who trawl the streets at night in order to shoot footage of the latest violent crimes and car crashes which they then sell to news channels. Lou quickly rises to the top of his (dubious) profession through blackmail, sabotage and practically speaking murder. Those puppy dog eyes are well and truly gone.

__The Boxtrolls - 05:30__

To end on a more uplifting note, we have the stop-motion animated film _The Boxtrolls _to guide you into morning. In the fictional town of Cheesebridge, the subterranean Boxtrolls have garnered an unfair reputation for kidnapping young kids in the middle of the night when in fact they are peaceful cardboard-box wearing creatures which scavenge at night to find materials for their latest inventions. Cheesebridge’s mayor strikes a deal with the chief pest exterminator to rid the town of as many boxtrolls as can be and boxtrolls soon start disappearing. Despite their reclusive nature, the boxtrolls and Eggs, their adopted human friend, work together to rehabilitate their image.
