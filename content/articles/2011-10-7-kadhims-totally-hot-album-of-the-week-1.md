Clams Casino
_Instrumental Mixtape_
 2011

Instrumental hip-hop is officially ‘it’. You can’t go more than a few hours in the day without some producer deciding that hip-hop would be infinitely better without an [ex-parole officer pretending to be gangster](http://bossip.com/91874/rick-ross-finally-admits-to-being-one-timeat-one-time/) over his beloved beats. Remove the distracting, tired clichés about having a big dick and you’re left with atmosphere, nuance, and the kind of music that will leave you rolling your shoulders hypnotically for hours on end.

Clams Casino’s [free mixtape](http://www.mediafire.com/?rj1opi3oa3r8l24), released in April, is the perfect embodiment of this instrumental hip-hop ethos. It has emotion; it has syncopated drums rolling over each other like kids falling down a hill; and it has a sense of the epic, which hip-hop can usually only create with obnoxiously loud horns, a la Usher’s ‘Yeah’.

Towards the end of the summer term, when most of us have finished our exams (sucks to be you, Biologists/Biochemists), the Union sometimes has a DJ outside, floating music through the sun in the Quad. My little dream is that the DJ will turn off the bro-step, and stick on this super-smooth mixtape.

_If you masturbate regularly on Pitchfork you’ll definitely know more about instrumental hip-hop than me. Tell me how much more by tweeting me [@kadhimshubber](http://twitter.com/kadhimshubber). (Better still, tweet [@NMEmagazine](http://twitter.com/nmemagazine) and tell them to give me a job.)_
