March 2017 saw the phoenix that is Nintendo rise from its ashes with the release of its new console the Nintendo Switch. Marketed as a truly versatile game console, the Switch can be played in three modes – TV mode for the traditionalists who like a big TV, tabletop mode for when a big TV screen isn’t socially acceptable (the Switch comes with its own portable screen) and handheld mode – so you can play anywhere, anytime. A local multiplayer mode is included, where eight people can play together in a local set up (MarioKart DS memories). The Switch boasts two handheld controllers which can be used when playing single player, multiplayer or when you just want good ol’ motion control (just like your trusty vintage Wii remote).

Games include popular titles like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Mario and Rabbids Kingdom Battle and Super Mario Odyssey. According to September 2017 sales figures, the Nintendo Switch has been immensely popular; selling 7.63 million units globally at £279.99 each.

April 2017 saw the US release of the Amazon Echo Look. The Look is essentially an Alexa assistant with a voice controlled camera. Its purpose? Take photos/videos of you in your favourite outfits and provide suggestions based on specialist fashion advice. It also helps you keep track of your styles, colours and the brands you wear – so you don’t wear the same thing twice! The Look retails for $199.99 in the US and is currently invite only.

November was a bumper month for tech announcements and releases; ranging from the smartphones, and supercars to high-end games consoles. Microsoft released a high-end version of Xbox One – the Xbox One X. A games console tailored specifically for 4K immersive gameplay with spatial sound whilst being backwards compatible with the Xbox One. The release comes alongside exclusive 4K titles: Forza Motorsport 7, State of Decay 2 and Crackdown 3. Highly doubted by critics for its focus on specialist gamers, the initial Xbox One X sales figures surprised many; selling 80,000 units in its first week in the UK, outpacing the PS4 Pro which took four weeks post release to reach similar numbers.

The world’s biggest tech company Apple, dropped a bombshell (although there were numerous leaks beforehand) in November, releasing the iPhone X (“10”) – the 10th anniversary edition iPhone. As well as being the most iconic iPhone design in a while, Apple decided to ditch TouchID in favour of FaceID,  allowing you to unlock your phone and pay using just your face. 2017 was the year of shrinking smartphone bezels and Apple pushed the boat out by scrapping the iconic Home Button, replacing it with gestures to access the home screen and multitask. The iPhone X also saw a design revamp, featuring a glass back – marking a return for iPhones with cracked backs and enabling wireless charging for the first time. Under the hood, the iPhone X features an A11 bionic chip which can execute 600 billion operations per second, easily supporting new features like Animojis and portrait mode selfies and lighting. Retailing at £999, although quite pricey, initial pre-order iPhone Xs sold out within ten minutes on release day.

Announced in 2017, but set to release in 2020, Tesla blew many away by announcing the Tesla Roadster, an all-electric supercar. The release photos and videos show a truly BEAUTIFUL car. The specifications themselves are objectively incredible: reaching 0-60mph in 1.9 seconds, 0-100mph in 4.2 seconds and a top speed of over 250mph. Many electric cars are plagued by poor range, but the Roadster promises 620 miles on a single charge. Supercars aren’t great for families? Think again… the Roadster is equipped with four seats and a retractable glass roof, wowing adults and children alike. Initial orders for the base model start at $200,000, better start checking for that spare change behind the sofa…

These were some of 2017’s biggest announcements, but we saw many other tech introductions including the Google Pixel 2, Google Home series and Samsung Galaxy S8 and Note 8 – let’s hope 2018 is just as great!
