When it comes to Twitter, musicians usually have one of two personalities:

1) No personality – SINGLE OUT NOW!!! *yawn*
 2) Uber-kick-ass insight into their awesome psyche – “[DEAR LORD RYAN GOSLING GETT ON MY FACE](http://twitter.com/#!/SLOWCLUBREBECCA/status/121304664699449344)”.

[Slow Club](http://www.slowclubband.com/)’s Rebecca Taylor falls into the latter category (indeed, the second example is one of her tweets). Her [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/#!/SLOWCLUBREBECCA) is a massive middle finger to the twee image that their first album constructed. Without turning this review into a convoluted love letter to her, is there a girl you’d want to hang out with more than one who [tweets](http://twitter.com/#!/SLOWCLUBREBECCA/status/123733058645000192): “Why isn’t my bbm working I’m trying to send a picture of my dick (shaped bruise) to my friend Stacey this is an OUTRAGE”

Slow Club’s second album, [_Paradise_](http://open.spotify.com/album/3EMfhZXmhhhRvBff1Vq6hj), is less a ‘middle finger’ and more a ‘slightly cheeky two-fingered salute’ to their aforementioned twee image. Bandmate Charles Watson has been relegated to guitar and backing vocals, and while they still write upbeat indie-folk love songs, there’s more texture, complexity, and humanity. If their first album is a sweet stickman drawing, their second is more like the dense palette that adorns its album cover.

Underpinning all of this is Rebecca Taylor. The same girl who [tweets](http://twitter.com/#!/SLOWCLUBREBECCA/status/122765030797225985), “100 PINTS OF WINE PLEASE BAR KEEP”, also writes beautiful phrases like “A chauffeur-driven dream” and sings them with the sensitivity of a neutrino detector (Zing!). Which makes her pretty awesome in my books. Oh dear, I’ve turned this review into a convoluted love letter after all.

_If you get bored this weekend, drink 100 pints of wine and tweet me from the hospital [@kadhimshubber](http://twitter.com/#!/kadhimshubber). Better still, photoshop a picture of Ryan Gosling sitting on Taylor’s face and tweet her [@SLOWCLUBREBECCA](http://twitter.com/#!/SLOWCLUBREBECCA)._
