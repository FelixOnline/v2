 - to stop UKIP becoming the biggest party Democracy getting in your wayIts the immigration stupid Reform that and UKIP will disappear Keep borders open and they will grow The EU at least since 1995 to my own knowlege has been controlling the British education system with a 5th column that stretches from Brussles down through every townhall University college school and classroom in the UK The EU has got the same process working in all other EU states School teachers are the number one victims of this relentless EU brainwashing At least someone has blown the cover on this group called British Influence but this is just a tiny part of what is going on in our education systemAll the long years Lib Lab Con have been fighting each other and they want special nasties For UKIP why not Tories or Labour or LiberalStudents have been under the lefts brainwashing wing for yearsthats why they want votes for schoolboys because they are being raised in the lefts image

A pro-European Union campaign group has opened itself up to potential charges of breaches of charity regulations by contacting Imperial Union to ask for help in its campaign “to stop UKIP becoming the biggest party” in the 2014 European elections. In an email to the Union President and the Campaigns Officer dated October 17, Joe Coney, the Campaign Director at British Influence, wrote that the group believed that “a significant UKIP win would be bad news on issues such as gender and LGBT equality and stopping climate change”. Coney went on to offer to “host a campaign training session [at Imperial] before Christmas” and asked to discuss “any ways in which the Student Union could help [British Influence] get more students to vote in the election”.

However, as a registered charity, the Union is not legally allowed to campaign on matters which are deemed to be ultra vires – that is matters which do not directly affect Imperial students. In his email, Coney wrote that while British Influence realised the “charity status means that the SU can’t campaign,” the group would like to offer to campaign for the Union and Imperial students on this issue.
 Replying to the email, Union President David Goldsmith wrote that while the proposal “is interesting, it is crucial that Imperial College Union, as a registered charity, remains neutral on party political issues, and although [British Influence is] not a political party, supporting [the] campaign would essentially mean the Union taking a view against a particular party”. He directed Coney to the Union’s many political societies, saying that they are “more able to campaign on political issues if it falls within their aims and objectives as a society”.

While British Influence seemed to be satisfied with this response, a disgruntled senior Union officer, who wishes to remain anonymous, has confirmed to Felix that they passed on the text of the original email to Paul Staines – a controversial right wing blogger and columnist better known by the pseudonym Guido Fawkes. Stains subsequently wrote about the issue in his regular column in the Sun on Sunday, prompting widespread criticism of British Influence on social media. Steve Crowther, the UKIP part chairman, has been reported as having requested that the Charity Commission investigate the incident.
 British Influence has played down allegations of impropriety, telling Staines that “this was just a clumsily worded email”. At the time of going to print the Union had not released an official statement.
