Straight-talking Politics

The race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination has highlighted the power of “straight-talking” politics and its ability to engage the otherwise apolitical masses. In each debate and interview we’ve watched as candidates attempt to trump each other with ever more outlandish and offensive statements.

The two current front-runners, Donald Trump and Ben Carson, have shown that a sizable proportion of right-wing Americans have grown disillusioned with conventional politics and career politicians. In this political climate, it wasn’t massively surprising when Kanye West announced he would run for President in 2020, at this year’s VMAs.
> Kanye is certainly to the left of some of the current Democratic candidates
Whilst Trump and Carson’s celebrity appeal seems to have played a part in their success, it’s the “honest” politics that they’ve both been promoting that Kanye will hope to emulate the most. Whether he has the ability to connect with Americans in the same way that others have done is questionable, but he does have a certain confidence in himself (particularly in his impressive body of work) that few of his future contemporaries could ever aim to reproduce.

The tweets he comes out with aren’t far from the nonsensical and often contentious words that are unflaggingly excreted from the hole in Donald Trump’s leathered face – so it would be unfair to dismiss his candidacy completely. Kanye has endorsed the Democratic party a number of times in the past, so one might assumption that he would run on some sort of progressive platform, although (confusingly) in recent weeks he has praised Ben Carson, a politician whose views are somehow even more shameless and idiotic than Trump’s, saying: “This is the most brilliant guy.” Oh, Kanye.

Kanye’s political positions are particularly difficult to discern. It would interesting to ask how he thinks he could make America great again, and it’s likely his response would focus on the social, racial and class issues that America faces today.

Race and Class

I would once have argued that race would be Kanye’s biggest talking point – it’s a recurring theme throughout his lyrics and in his public appearances. He famously claimed live on-air, during a benefit concert for Hurricane Katrina relief in 2005, that “George Bush doesn’t care about black people.” Yet now he claims racism is no longer a problem in America; in his opinion, a single black president and his own personal success (and the success of his peers) prove that discrimination based on race isn’t really a thing. Apparently, the real issue is class, and people inviting you to dinners just to laugh at your teeth. It’s hard not to feel sorry for a man with a fortune of over $100 million who isn’t being included and respected in the way he wants. Through his rise to the top he has grown incredibly self-absorbed, which he even admits himself: “I embody every characteristic of the egotistic.” It’s worrying that he’s starting to lose touch with the reality of Black America; classism is obviously a problem but deep-rooted prejudices against the black community must be solved first rather than completely ignored.

Income Inequality

Ye has little to say about income inequality or the greed of corporate America, which isn’t surprising for a man who charges thousands of dollars for torn grey sweaters. He did once show up in support of the Occupy Wall Street movement, resulting in a rather awkward interview in which he nodded along quietly as fellow activist Russell Simmons explained his position. More recently, he tweeted his disapproval of exploitative mobile games: “Fuck any game company that puts in-app purchases on kids games!!!” Just last year, the European Commission introduced measures to protect children from in-app purchases – could we see President West doing something similar? Maybe not if Kim has any say in the matter – with her app, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, bringing in over $200 million in revenue last year.

Foreign Affairs

His position on foreign affairs is slightly less confusing. Having expressed opposition to the Iraq war, Kanye is certainly to the left of some of the current Democratic candidates. However, there’s the slight worry that he might have a fetish for global nuclear devastation – as is the only situation in which his weirdly post-apocalyptic, hunger-games inspired clothes line would actually make sense. Is this the beautiful dark twisted fantasy he’s been raving about?

Education

Education features prominently in Kanye’s discography; his debut album The College Dropout reflects on his decision to drop out of college in pursuit of his musical dreams (much to the disappointment of his mother). He’s publicly advocated for the modernisation of Arts education in the past, suggesting: “People are so behind. There’s poetry classes, but why aren’t there rap curriculums?” So, it’s likely that his presidency would see some sort of overhaul of public education. The fashion establishment also hasn’t been as inclusive as Kanye would have hoped, and last year he even applied to fashion school: “I wanted to go to Central Saint Martins, but Louise Goldin said that I was too famous.” Maybe he’ll introduce fashion school legislation to introduce quotas for self-loving multi-millionaires.

The Political Class

It’s also important to consider how Kanye would fit into the political establishment in Washington. Major political figures haven’t totally dismissed his aspirations; both Hillary Clinton and Obama mentioned him this week, with the former recommending that “he might want to wait beause I’ll be running for reelection.” The Democrat front-runner then went onto suggest that she wasn’t completely averse to Kanye running as her Vice President in 2020.

It’s entirely possibly that Hillary won’t win next year or run for re-election in 2020, so Ye might want consider who he would choose as his running mate. Arguably, the most obvious contender would be Taylor Swift. Their relationship has come a long way since the infamous 2009 VMAs. Last month, Swift presented West with the Video Vanguard Award, and Swift took to Instagram to thank Kanye for flowers he had sent. A Swift/West alliance could be unstoppable.

I’m not sure that Kanye really understands politics, or what it means to be a politician in America. The Citizens United case in 2010 essentially legalised bribery, so if Kanye is really serious he’ll need to start making even more friends with very deep pockets (he may owe Jay-Z a few favours if he ever finds himself sitting in the Oval Office).

So far this year over $400 million has been been raised in political donations, and in all recent elections the candidate with most financial backing has always won. After his initial announcement that he was planning to run in 2020, Kanye was quoted as saying “I hate politics. I’m not a politician at all. I care about the truth and I just care about human beings. I just want everyone to win.” So far, so good.

“When I run for president, I’d prefer not to run against someone, I would be like ‘I want to work with you’.” You’ve got to admire his optimism, but in reality this naivety could be his downfall. Everyone knows the Republican party won’t play nicely. If he does actually run in 2020 (which I’m sure will somehow be aligned with the release of a new album), he’s got a lot of learning to do.

It’s hard to imagine a world in which Kanye could win the Democratic primary, let alone become become President of the most powerful nation on Earth. That being said, if Donald Trump wins in 2016 anything could be possible, and America’s appetite for change could be greater than ever. Kanye’s next album, Late Nomination, will be released in 2020, probably.
