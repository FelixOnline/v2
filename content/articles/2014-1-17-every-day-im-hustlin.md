“Thank god for me”, says Rosalyn Rosenfeld (Jennifer Lawrence), after setting fire to her brand new microwave, ignoring her husband’s advice to not put something metallic in there. She then proceeds to furiously tackle some housework whilst listening to ‘Live and Let Die’. Yes, thank god for Jennifer Lawrence, who steals the show completely with her utmost confidence and relentless energy in David O. Russell’s smart heist comedy that is no doubt the director’s best film to date.

That’s not to say the rest of the cast under-performs. The big names in this star-studded ensemble, most of whom who have worked with Russell before, are all on top form, with even a bonus cameo appearance from a screen veteran who makes the most of his brief, uncredited appearance in which he scares the hell out of everyone by being a smart, bilingual mob boss.

Based on the ABSCAM (Arab-scam) sting operation in which a number of corrupt politicians were arrested for taking bribes, we first meet Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) who hustle money off of desperate individuals ready to fork over large sums over the promise of massive returns. Everything seems to be going swimmingly for this couple, an arrangement that is not only beneficial financially, but also in terms of embarking on a love affair. But their ideal world is shattered when FBI Agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) arrests the pair. Giving them very limited options, this ambitious Fed is looking to take down some of the biggest names he can think of, all for the benefit of his career.

The idea behind _American Hustle_ is that everyone here is desperate to find their own versions of ideal happiness. And to do so what they resort to is deception. They lie to others, and sometimes lie to themselves. Irving’s volatile, tiresome relationship with his wife, Rosalyn, is one that will generate the most laughs, but it’s a relationship that is also the most thought-provoking. Irvin and Rosalyn are together for various reasons, and love barely features in them. And when the truth hits her, most devastatingly so when her husband’s mistress Sydney boldly faces off against her, Rosalyn is a vulnerable, teary, insecure mess, a scene for which Lawrence deserves an Oscar.

Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner, rocking a retro hairdo that is criminal by today’s standards) is the major target of Richie’s new operation, one that is barely approved by his agency superior Stoddard Thorsen (Louie C.K. in a priceless supporting role). Carmine’s love and dedication for the state of New Jersey is unashamedly used and manipulated by the authorities to bag what they want, and in the end it’s difficult to not feel some sort of remorse for an all-round enthusiastic family man who wanted nothing more than to set a good example to his constituents.

The “scam” itself is full of hilarious moments as not everything goes exactly to plan. One of many examples of this is having to settle for a Hispanic FBI agent to pose as a rich Arabian Sheik who will be providing all the false bribe money. The “good guys” are all desperate for their plans to succeed, and it’s in their sincere, earnest efforts that the sparks begin to fly and the script starts to have fun with unpredictable twists and turns.

“He wasn’t necessarily in good shape, and he had this combover that was rather elaborate, but he had this confidence that drew me to him” says Sydney in a voiceover that explains the immediate attraction she had for her partner in crime. Throwing Richie into the mix and the bubbling sexual tension that arises with Sydney in the middle of it all, constantly flashing her side-boobs in her many different outfits, is a car crash waiting to happen.

Are Sydney and Irving a steady enough couple to survive the cage-rattling by Richie? Is Richie only using Sydney to gain what he wants? If push comes to shove, will Irving choose his mistress or his wife? Can Irving really betray Carmine who is slowly but surely becoming a good friend of his? Where does Sydney’s heart truly lie? Should Rosalyn really be looking after a young son? The classic game of who’s conning whom takes place and for those wanting to get to the very top, security and freedom, difficult decisions must be made and it’s in these fascinating characters Russell’s smart, sexy heist comedy is made complete.

_American Hustle_ is an absolute blast from start to finish and it never lets go in terms of gripping the audience with its intriguing plot and unique characters caught up in highly entertaining scenarios. Released towards the end of 2013 in the States, it’s no surprise there’s a lot of awards attention surrounding this, and although it’s way too early to call it for the 2014 European film market, _American Hustle_ will remain as one of 2014’s best.
