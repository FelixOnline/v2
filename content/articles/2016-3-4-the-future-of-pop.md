Until recently, many saw the netlabel and electronic collective **PC Music** as the future of pop. However, even after a number of brilliant, innovative releases they’ve remained on the fringes. **Danny L Harle**’s debut EP _Broken Flowers_, their first release on a major label, might have had a single that made it onto BBC Radio 1’s ‘A-List’, but he’s failed to capitalise on this success. Similarly, **SOPHIE**’s compilation album, _Product_, which was released last year seemed like a bit of a flop, considering that its release also coincided with the launch of a sex toy.

The collective have now started to look towards mainstream pop to find their success. Before the debut of his record last year, a collaboration between SOPHIE and **Charli XCX** had been circulating around the internet for a while. It combined Charli XCX’s familiar voice with the sugar coated production of SOPHIE, creating something truly futuristic.

This collaboration, ‘Vroom Vroom’, would end up being the name of Charli XCX’s new label, Vroom Vroom Recordings. She describes it as label where the artists will be “sharp, potent and deadly”. The first release on the label, an EP also called _Vroom Vroom_, was released last week – produced by SOPHIE and with a guest appearance from PC Music’s _Hannah Diamond_.

Starting off full throttle, the EP’s namesake sees Charli XCX imitate a car. She sings “Beep Beep” and “Vroom Vroom” mixed with the real sounds of an automotive. And on the chorus she’s fully aware of her pole position in the race to the top of pop: “Bitches know they can’t catch me”. The song is a confident, and energetic statement of new lifestyle, having recently moved to L.A.

‘Paradise’ begins on a chipmunk-ified chorus, with ethereal tones reflecting the core lyric: “Tonight, we’re in paradise”. It soon skitters into more experimental beats, with the pops and squeaks which SOPHIE has become known for.

Uma Thurman’s line from Pulp Fiction, “I wanna win / I want that trophy,” is sampled on ‘Trophy,’ a song which will feel far more familiar to fans of Charli XCX’s previous work. She exclaims “All the girls ‘round the world, now we in control,” and there’s clear aspiration to be like Marilyn Monroe: “Take the crown, shut it down, ‘bout to steal the show / Shooting star, I’m a boss” (a reference to the book Shooting Star: Marilyn Monroe). Empowering would be an understatement, ‘Trophy’ is thunderous and explosive, with the chant “Throw it up” encouraging club goers.

The ballad-like closer, ‘Secret’, is the EP’s biggest surprise. It’s snappy and trappy, with a cheeky “Shh” emphasising it’s obvious theme.

Many have called PC Music hyper-consumerist pop, self-aware in its commercial appeal. _Vroom Vroom_ is the first sign of the collective transcending this label; Charli XCX adds substance and meaning to their winning electro-pop formula.

PC Music are branching out and assimilating. Charli XCX is savvy of the true future of pop; her next album, also produced by SOPHIE, could be her biggest hit yet.
