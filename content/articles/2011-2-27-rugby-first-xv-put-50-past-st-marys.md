Following the fifteen’s crushing victory over Portsmouth the previous week, Imperial again showed impressive away from, turning over St Mary’s seconds by a massive score.

The game was played in atrocious conditions with rain showering down on an already sodden pitch. Imperial were not to be deterred though and started the game with drive creating line breaks among the backs from the very outset of the match. They were rewarded with a try by Graeme Ridler who, in the act of scoring stole the ball from full-back Louie Barnett. This was just the start and Ridler’s try was followed by three tries from driven line outs; two were scored by Ed Labinksi and one from captain and man of the match Caolan Cotter.

Imperial’s only setback was a contentious try which they will have been disappointed to concede against limited opponents, this seemed to spur the Imperial on and second half scores by Joe Harris, Toby Spittle and Ben Adubi, whose quick thinking off a tap and go allowed him to continue his rich vein of form and score.

There was no shortage of flair on display either; Labinski added his third try after selling numerous dummies and sidesteps which should not be in the repertoire of a newly converted openside. Not to be outdone, second row Charlie Esberger produced a sumptuous flick behind his back, allowing Cotter to make a break. Fly-half James Hayward had a good day with the boot, converting five tries and a penalty.

Despite the good result, Imperial face their sternest test when they face Reading, at home this Wednesday.
