     Not related to this incident, but more to the location. <br>Have you noticed that vehicles going through Exhibition road, not only they do not respect the speed limit, supposed to be 20 ( maybe the signs are too small!), but also seem to be totally unaware of the type of road they're on which I believe was meant to be shared , that is giving pedestrians greater priority! <br>To my experience, it's very rare to find any motorist slowing, or giving way to anyone trying to cross. <br> <br>,Love the website-- really user friendly and great deals to see!| <br>nba 2k16 mt for sale http://www.nusajaya.net/item/169,Howdy, excellent online site you've here.| <br>nba 2k16 my endorsements http://www.ibase45.net/blogs/263/11523/studio-sues-makers-of-nba-2k16-for-using-player-tattoos,BGdczh ehnfncqwbgkp, [url=http://imuhmcyocclu.com/]imuhmcyocclu[/url], [link=http://qogxveabhlkc.com/]qogxveabhlkc[/link], http://nloojeotuaxf.com/

Two women were treated for minor injuries after their car was flipped onto its roof due to a collison with a lorry on Exhibition Road. The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon outside the Natural History Museum, which also saw a Rolls-Royce take damage.

Speaking to the London Evening Standard, businessman Mohamad Ridha, the owner of the Rolls-Royce, described the dramatic moment when the hatchback was thrown into the air and almost crashed on top of his car. “I was behind the two women as the hatchback waited in traffic”, said the 30-year old.

“A truck came round the corner and had forgotten to close his back door. Everyone was waving and beeping to try and warn him. The metal ledge that was hanging down, it banged into the car and got stuck under its front, dragged it a little way then lifted it up in the air and threw it on to the floor.”

Ridha estimates that the damage caused the the hatchback hitting the front of his car will “cost about £20,000 or £30,000 in repairs. It all happened so fast, I was very shocked - we were thinking the car was going to come through the window.”

He also told how he and other bystanders rushed to the aid of the two women in the car after the car flipped. “They were banging on the doors and windows asking for help. We got them out. They were shocked and didn’t believe what happened. I’ve never seen something like this in my life.”

Emergency services were called to the scene shortly after 2pm, with footage captured showing the London Fire Brigade righting the overturned car with manpower. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said officers were called at 14.22pm to reports of a car flipped on to its roof, with paramedics treating two women for minor injuries.
