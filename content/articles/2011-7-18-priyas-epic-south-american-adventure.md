For eight weeks starting in September 2010 we decided to embark on an epic, whistlestop tour of South America, following the well-renowned gringo trail. [Beginning](http://felixonline.co.uk/travel/689/my-south-american-debut-/) in Rio de Janeiro, we soaked in the [Latin vibrancy and passion of Brazil](http://felixonline.co.uk/travel/704/finding-tranquility-in-chaos/), crossing the border at the [dramatic Iguazu Falls](http://felixonline.co.uk/travel/842/tragic-tourism-perils/) and walking straight in to the [beating heart of Argentina's capital city, Buenos Aires](http://felixonline.co.uk/travel/762/ambling-argentinean-escapades-/). From there we ventured up to the staggeringly scenic [icy mountain ranges of Bariloche](http://felixonline.co.uk/travel/860/the-underrated-sound-of-silence-/), cycled through the [vineyards of Mendoza](http://felixonline.co.uk/travel/1123/tall-tales-and-the-runs/) and spiralled on a [bumpy bus ride up into Santiago](http://felixonline.co.uk/travel/1195/some-santiagan-satisfaction/), Chile. After halting for food-poisoning, we sandboarded down Death Valley and crossed over the breathtaking salt flats of the Salar de Uyuni in to Bolivia. There [we partied at high altitude in La Paz](http://felixonline.co.uk/travel/1279/bolivia-calamity-and-comfort/) before ferrying over to the Isla del Sol, where [we endured a gruelling climb to our most eagerly anticipated landmark](http://felixonline.co.uk/travel/1369/trekking-to-machu-picchu/), Machu Picchu in Peru. Our last stop was Arequipa, where we white-water rafted through Chilli creek and [cycled down El Misti, Peru's stony, sandy and slippery active volcano](http://felixonline.co.uk/travel/1401/return-of-the-mummy/), before finally departing from Lima airport.

South America was an adrenaline fuelled whirlwind of incredible sights, unbelievable views, surprisingly affectionate greetings and memories that will last a lifetime -â€“ I just can't wait to go back.
