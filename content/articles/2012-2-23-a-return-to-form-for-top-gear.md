     A very eloquent and well written description of why I haven't been excited about top gear in about 2 years. I somewhat suspect that the personalities involved got the idea that everything they touched turned to gold and didn't realise that the most enjoyable part of the show was the cars themselves, as opposed to the people reviewing them. ,I agree that the Fenton parody was amusing; the highlight of that feature in fact. The rest of it wasn't great though, was it? <br> <br>I'm not entirely sure if you actually read my review or not but i'd like to highlight a few bits of it for you. First of all, I find Top Gear entertaining (that bit was made quite clear in the first sentence). Secondly, the reason I don't find it funny anymore is that most of the jokes are the same and have been repeated over and over again (this opinion was also made fairly clear in the first paragraph). <br> <br>It certainly doesn't seem like you managed to reach the final paragraph, so let me summarise it for you; Top Gear is improving. It has show

Ever since its rebirth in 2002, [_Top Gear_](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mj59) has provided me with Sunday night entertainment and it’s always been brilliant. Well actually that isn’t entirely true. You see, _Top Gear_’s entertainment value has decreased hugely in recent years – the ‘humour’ has become entirely predictable and largely infantile, whilst fewer and fewer cars are actually being reviewed and much like I expect Hangman to be offensive, I expect a car show to be about cars.

In the last two or three years the balance has been completely wrong – it’s been three idiots larking about doing pointless challenges and occasionally reviewing a car if the mood takes them. My primary reason for tuning in to _Top Gear_ each week is to see the car reviews and tests, I don’t think to myself ‘oh I want to watch some comedy – I’ll watch _Top Gear_!’

You can imagine then that it was to my delight that the first episode of the current series (number 18 if you were wondering) was fantastic (excepting will.i.am as the guest; he was a bit boring). The three lads went on a road trip through Italy in a Lamborghini, a McLaren and a Noble – what more could you want. This was – as the case usually is with _Top Gear_ – beautifully filmed and produced. Fantastic. _Top Gear_ is back.

I was even happier when the second episode was also up to (if not exceeding) scratch. It saw a genuinely interesting feature in which Richard Hammond explored the world of NASCAR, a sport which is rarely mentioned here in Blighty followed by Jeremy reviewing the new Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Roadster. Even what I usually find the most tedious part of the show, the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car, was genuinely amusing and interesting although I guess that’s what you’d expect from Matt LeBlanc. The episode ended with a feature in which Jeremy and James investigated the growing Chinese car market, most of which are cheap copies of European marques. Even that was interesting and not too infantile for my liking.

> Episode three was what you'd describe as terrible

Episode three was not like the first two episodes. Episode three was what you’d describe as terrible. After watching it I felt more annoyed than someone with no sense of humour reading Hangman. James reviewed a Vauxhall Corsa VXR and a Fiat Panda, whilst Clarkson and Hammond wasted time trying to direct a car chase for a remake of _The Sweeney_.

It was a mixed bag with episode four – it started well with James traveling to Florida to review the Fisker Karma – a surprisingly good looking and well made electric car. He did of course end up going off track and meeting AC/DC frontman Brian Johnson to drive his 1928 Bentley. Although that was no bad thing as the Bentley is a beautiful piece of craftsmanship and design. Following this Jeremy reviewed the Ferrari FF and Bentley Continental GT on ice in Northern Sweden which made for surprisingly good viewing. The final feature of the episode involved the trio each making off road mobility scooters and testing them against commercially available versions. It was neither interesting nor funny. All it managed to do was ruin what was a pretty decent episode.

So has _Top Gear _returned to form? No. Not yet. It’s certainly the best it's been for a few years, but I still find myself debating whether it’s worth my time or not. It’s almost as if it’s going through a mid life crisis. It needs a new lease of life – a breath of fresh air. To me _Top Gear_ should be a showcase for the mechanical excellence and beauty of new cars whilst providing an arena in which to promote the joy of driving, not some cringeworthy childish ‘entertainment’ show.
