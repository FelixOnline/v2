There is little doubt that when development involves the empowerment of communities and spread of innovative ideas, lives will be changed. From the poorest of the poor to the war-torn regions of the globe, issues concerning people’s needs and rights interlink each and every one of us. When the standard of living and quality of life suffers in the face of issues such as healthcare, food scarcity and education, then onlookers beyond borders must act. Contributing to international development is of paramount importance as we head into mid 21st century. From technology to policy or social movements, progressive reform can take many guises. The introduction of large-scale, low cost vaccination to lower infant mortality, or strains of crop designed to survive harsh conditions to provide agricultural livelihoods both exemplify actions that have lessened huge health and environmental burdens on developing countries. Yet, these reforms make the news for their scale and involvement of international governments. Dig below the surface and you’ll find a whole host of progressive movements that are revolutionising the face of development. And most of the time these can be identified by three key features: community, technology and the presence of youth.

On average, 60% of the population in the world’s poorest countries are under 25 years old and are persistently affected by the problems that stem from poverty. From unemployment to HIV risk to poor governance, the problems that young people face are only exacerbated further by the fact that young people are frequently overlooked or excluded from the decision making practices that directly impact on their lives. Corruption within schools often means quality education is only available in exchange for a sex act, or a back hander, and for many young women there is often no other option than engaging in risky and exploitative activities.But when given the opportunity, young people can and young people do. Which is why, at the Imperial International Development Conference 2014 we want to turn the focus to the amazing things young people are doing globally to be recognised as the solution to many of the world’s problems, and how young people are paving the way for change. Technology is also a huge driving force for change. From instant messaging, to mobile-phone based sexual health lessons and solar drive technology for refrigerating vaccinations, tech based solutions are helping to address some of the problems frequently encountered in developing countries. Not only this but they are providing a tool to empower youth to be active participants in developing their country, to voice their opinions and ideas about economic growth, and to promote social stability.

On the 15th February, highly acclaimed academics in the international development arena, from leading universities, institutes and NGOs, will offer up an incredible insight into the dynamic change that can result when youth, science and technology intersect. Centred on ’Harnessing Youth Power and Science & Technology for Global Change’, a series of talks and panels will aim to reveal the true worth of youth empowerment and technological growth in developing countries. Prepare yourself for no holds barred question sessions, heated debates and inspirational speakers and expect no less than to gain a huge amount of knowledge and to be swept up in the youth led revolution. You do not have long to wait either, as early bird tickets (until this Sunday!) are flying off the shelves. This is one event in the Imperial calendar that you do not want to miss out on!
