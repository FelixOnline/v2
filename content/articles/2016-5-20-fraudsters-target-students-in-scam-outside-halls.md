This week, a student was conned into handing over cash to fraudsters on Prince Consort Road.

Two men in a white Audi stopped the student near Beit, pretending to be Armani salesman.

They got chatting, and persuaded the student that they had leather jackets to give away. The fraudsters told the student that they “didn’t want to pay tax” on the garments, and that he could have them for free.

The men then somehow persuaded the student that they were in need of cash to buy their children souvenirs. The student got into their car, a white Audi, and they drove him to a cash machine, where he withdrew £800 and gave it to the men.

They then dropped him back at college.

A similar incident is believed to have occurred outside Fisher in Evelyn Gardens.

Two men in a white Renault attempted a similar scam on Queens Gate this week too. Fortunately, a student who had previously been a victim of the con stopped and took pictures of the men and their car, before warning the other student off.

Police believe the fraudsters are particularly targeting Imperial students. It’s thought that these con artists may be specifically targeting international students.

The warning from college is to immediately report to college security or wardening staff if you’re approached by anyone in this way. Students are advised not to attempt to challenge or speak to them, however tempting, and instead walk away. Obviously don’t get in their car.
