The Education and Student Experience Survey will be closing on Tuesday 19 February.

The survey is an anonymous way to tell the College your view on their future educational strategy. It is online and takes the form of a questionnaire with open text responses for students and staff to fill out with their thoughts on the education and student experience.

The survey is split up into four ‘strategic objectives’. Each one relates to the educational and student experience at Imperial. There are examples that are deemed useful from other institutions around the world and data from within College is provided next to the question.

An open meeting was held in Pippard Lecture Theatre in Sherfield at 17:00 on Thursday 14 February.

Staff and students are both invited to take part in the consultation. Professor Debra Humphris, Pro-Rector (Education), will be taking the data and creating a ‘green paper’ and finally a ‘white paper’. This will then be taken to the Management Board and College Council before it can be put into practice and acted upon.

Paul Beaumont, Union President, and Sir Keith O’Nions, President & Rector, have both urged all to fill it out in as much depth as possible.

The survey can be filled out online here:
