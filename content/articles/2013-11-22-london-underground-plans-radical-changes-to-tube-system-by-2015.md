London Underground and the Mayor of London announced new changes that will have a large impact on London’s tube system. Under the proposed changes by 2015 most manned ticket offices at tube stations will be closed, leading to a loss of 750 jobs. These changes have been set in motion as part of a plan to reduce TfL’s budget by approximately £50 million every year.
 Londoners received a significant improvement in services as part of the proposed plans, with several tube lines (including the Piccadilly, Victoria and Jubilee lines) set to run 24-hours a day on Fridays and Saturdays.
 These plans, while increasing night-time mobility for several groups of people (esp. students.) also modernise the tube, bringing it closer to the standard of other systems, such as New York’s 24/7/365 Subway system.
