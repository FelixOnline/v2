Imperial’s music scene is certainly underground. The bright morning sunshine rarely reaches its dark recesses and its artists receive little attention. The [Felix Music Nights](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=289649254397857) are our way of celebrating this under-appreciated scene and also fostering it; bringing more students into the tent and saying, “Hey, there’s a good thing going on here.” The formula hasn’t changed since [last year’s successes](http://felixonline.co.uk/music/946/1902-felix-music-night/): scout the finest DJs from [Music Tech](http://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/clubs-and-societies/a-to-z/m/music-tech/), sniff out some red-hot bands from [Jazz & Rock](http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/arts/jazzrock/), and grab London’s most hyped up-and-coming artists to headline.

Our headliner this time is rapper [__Mikill Pane__](http://mikillpane.com/). With some of the wittiest and weirdest lyrics around, he’s similar to [__Das Racist__](http://dasracist.net/). He shot to attention with his heart-wrenching rhymes on [__Ed Sheeran__](http://edsheeran.com/)’s track “[Little Lady](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEEj_0w0me4)” and has been overloading music blogs since, receiving praise from none-other than [__Dj Semtex__](http://www.djsemtex.com/blog/).

Below, Iñigo gives you a sneak-peek at the DJ lineup and how Felix and Music Tech started collaborating:

Felix approached [Music Tech Society](http://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/clubs-and-societies/a-to-z/m/music-tech/) in January of last year, about doing a WiiJ performance for their new student music night. [WiiJing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI6viVSKewc) is, essentially, hacking a Nintendo Wii remote to use for live music manipulation or, as the name suggests, DJing. Unfortunately, no hacking was in the works at the time. The suggestion did, however, inspire a new live element to the society. A live electronic improvisation group was banded, though it remained untitled by the time the night came along. Sadly, __No More Reality__, as it came to be dubbed, is no more, on the count of the academic dissidence of the local synth wizard. Such is life.

This time around, [KABLAAM](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=289649254397857) will see Music Tech behind the turntables for a tetrapak of electronic stimulation. Opening the evening, [__Not Indigo__](http://soundcloud.com/algo-ritmico) will warm up the sound system with an unorthodox amalgam of groovy head hop, chilled psychotropics and dubby rhythms. Keeping it slow and low, [__SMB__](http://soundcloud.com/smb) will provide some fine deep cuts from the frontiers of house and techno. Before the headliner hits the stage, [__Monsk__](http://soundcloud.com/user3090840)____ will warm the floor with his sensual blend of soulful polyrhythmia and throbbing low end. To close the evening, [__Niceberg__](http://soundcloud.com/dj_niceberg)____, a veteran of the Nintendisco retrogaming club night, will rip the speakers apart with an outburst of frantic bass music, cracking the cones into submission and eventual paralysis.

_[KABLAAM](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=289649254397857) is on Saturday 12th of November in Metric. Entry is only £3 and it starts at 7pm._
