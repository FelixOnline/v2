Incipio is pretty well known for its slimline iPhone cases. From the first generation through to the iPhone 4, Incipio has made some of the best minimal cases money can buy. So you could say Incipio’s latest, the feather for iPhone 4, has some big boots to fill.

Feather by name, feather by nature – at less than 1mm thick, it’s certainly minimal. In fact it’s the thinnest case I’ve come across, and fits the iPhone 4 exactly.The entire back is covered except for a hole for the camera lens and flash, while the side controls plus the top and bottom are exposed for easy access.

The case is made from a rigid, but soft-touch plastic, and clips onto the corners of the antenna band and along the sides, minus where the volume controls are located. This means that the glass screen sits about 1mm out from the case edges, essentially leaving it totally exposed. It’s a good thing then that Incipio have included two screen protectors in the box, but I can’t help thinking the edges of the screen are a little too exposed. Glass is glass after all, and an impact at the wrong angle means a shattered screen.

While it’s not going to help in the slightest if you drop your iPhone, if you’re just looking for a case to prevent that gorgeous glass back from getting all scratched up, the Incipio Feather for iPhone 4 is ideal.

Available in 12 different colours and yours for £15.
