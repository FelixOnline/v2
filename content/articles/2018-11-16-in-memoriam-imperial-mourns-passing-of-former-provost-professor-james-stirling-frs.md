Professor James Stirling, who served as Imperial's Provost from August 2013 to August 2018, passed away on Friday 9th November, surrounded by his family and loved ones.

Professor Stirling was a distinguished physicist, whose work resulted in more than 300 research papers. In his role as Provost, he championed the development and wellbeing of staff throughout the community, particularly focusing on marginalised and underrepresented groups. Following his retirement in Summer, and in recognition of his outstanding contributions to Physics and the College, Professor Stirling was awarded an honorary doctorate of science, Imperial’s highest honour, at October’s Commemoration Day celebration.

The Imperial community extends its deepest condolences to Professor Stirling's friends and family. Tom Wheeler, who served as President of Imperial College Union in 2014/15, was "heartbroken" to hear of Professor Stirling's passing and added: 

"I had the honour of working with James Stirling during my term as Union President. He was in touch with me days after I was elected and invited me into his office to learn about the impact I wanted to make, and ensure he understood the frustrations and challenges facing the student body. He was tenacious and focused, kind and compassionate. I can say with total confidence that your time at Imperial was made better due to his leadership."

Lucinda Sandon-Allum, who was Union President in 2015/16, echoed these sentiments, saying: 

"He was an extraordinary man who led an exceptional life and I know he will be sorely missed by all. I had the great privilege of working very closely with James during my year as President and felt so fortunate to see the difference he truly made to the lives of every student at Imperial. My deepest sympathies go out to his family - I know the Imperial community will cherish his memory dearly."

Nas Andriopoulos, who served as Union President in 2016/17, also paid tribute to Professor Stirling, saying:

"I had the privilege and honour of working with him for just a year but, in that period, I witnessed the dedication he showed for the lives of students at Imperial and a unique compassion with which he led. One quality that stands out to me above all others, is that he possessed an unusual caring for every student at Imperial. We should all mourn the loss of this great man and I hope we can celebrate his legacy in the years ahead. My deepest sympathies are with Paula [Professor Stirling's wife], James’ family and friends – I know he will be remembered with great fondness by the organisation he served with such dedication and distinction."

Finally, Nick Burstow, who was last year's Deputy President (Education), extended his condolences:
If you have read anything about the death of Professor James Stirling over the last few days, you will see references to his academic achievements; his Fellowship of the Royal Society; and his continued efforts to improve the wellbeing of staff at Imperial. But what has not been mentioned in as much depth as is deserved was his dedication to students. His dedication to us. 

I had the pleasure of working with Professor Stirling last year, when I served as your Deputy President (Education). In every meeting I shared with him, he always asked for the student view on matters. For our view on matters. No matter how high-level the committee, he treated the student view as equal to that of staff. 

For someone who occupied such an important position, Professor Stirling was down-to-earth, approachable, and totally committed to improving things for students. 

Professor Stirling also left a lasting impression on me personally. As every Deputy President (Education) before and after me will tell you, the first time representing your fellow 18,000 students at a high-level College committee can be daunting. But Professor Stirling always took the trouble to make me, and my fellow DPEs, feel at ease and involved in discussions. When I started my post last year, he asked to meet the Union’s five Officer Trustees to discuss our plans for the year ahead. When we met with him, he had already learnt our names, read our manifestos, and knew our main goals for the year. That was the kind of man he was.

As Professor Stirling’s colleagues mourn his passing, I think it is only right that we students acknowledge and celebrate someone who dedicated the last years of their working life to improving academia at Imperial. Professor Stirling will be remembered by many as the first Provost of Imperial, but he will be remembered for so much more by the people fortunate enough to have known him." 

All those at Imperial will continue to celebrate all that Professor Stirling achieved in his life and cherish the memories of his wisdom, grace, and warmth. There will be an opportunity for the Imperial community to gather in celebration of his life and accomplishments, details for which will be announced very soon.
