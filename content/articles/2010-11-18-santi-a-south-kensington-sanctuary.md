 - The Imperial Health Centre does offer some sort of massage and aromatherapy too This smells like an advertorial agreement which is rather unusual for a student publication WHAT IS THISThe Health Centre offers no such thing all they do is recommend external practitioners I dont think its unreasonable for Felix to write an article about a business offering students a 50 discountNHaksj  lffzedywmssb

There is a place, inconspicuous and elusive to the untrained eye, where the weathered creatures of West London emerge calm, bright and restored. A spa, in South Kensington, which offers the most advanced techniques to enhance and perfect the skin. Only what they don’t tell you, is that it all goes a little deeper than that.

As soon as you set foot inside the elegant Georgian building, you are welcomed in a sprawling front room of purest white; you are checked in and encouraged to help yourself to some of the perfectly placed fresh fruit and berries, and perhaps a cup of tea (Earl Grey, one sugar please). Believe me when I say, a shroud of calm seems already to descend – peace and quiet that you didn’t know you needed.

With a Spa Menu spanning from Massage and Facials to Laser Epilation, Tariq Karim and his team of delightful staff are very well equipped to bring you a few hours of much-needed indulgence, some rest and a retreat from the hustle and bustle of the outside world.

Did I mention that all this, and more, is available to Imperial students at a discounted rate? Bring your copy of Felix with you to your appointment at Santi and receive 50% off all services on weekdays between 11am-3pm. This could mean an hour’s massage for £30, or a facial for £50. They are also offering a student Laser Epilation package: 6 full treatments for lower legs, bikini and underarm for £700 – a highly discounted rate for permanent hair removal which usually costs upwards of £1800.

Laser hair removal uses Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) to selectively target the melanin concentrated in the hair follicle. When caught in a particular phase of hair growth, the follicle dies permanently causing the hair to fall out, never to grow back. In comparison to years of shaving, waxing or electronic epilating, it is actually quite an economically sensible option, and is suitable for all skin types.

I implore you, for an afternoon of much-needed you-time, Santi will rejuvenate the tired and over-worked of students. For this level of luxury with a price point that is now actually accessible, this is an unbeatable cure for the winter blues.
