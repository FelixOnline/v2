comments:
 - I must say that this is one of the most beautiful poems I have ever read Never before has the anguish of heartbreak been so artfully described I truly feel for the author this Harrion Rickerby this master of the English language this hidden genius The review of the music pales in comparison with the strength of the poem and one hopes that Mr Rickerby will continue to delight us all with his manipulation of the written word

This is certainly the best album released so far this year, and it will probably remain that way unless __Joanna Newsom__ sneaks out another before December. Often sounding very 80s with Peter Gabriel-esque synths on the opener ‘Perth’ and familiar pop-rock nuances on ‘Beth/Rest’, the album combines a huge range of influences in interesting and varied ways. Remarkably, however, the albums is completely cohesive and utterly original. This eponymous second album is streets ahead of his previous (and excellent) record _For Emma, Forever Ago_, which, when listened to after __Bon Iver__, simply sounds dull and repetitive. Finding words to describe the sheer beauty of this album is difficult, but I wrote a poem to explain how it makes me feel.

__Autumn__

Autumn breeze frigidly touches ailing dreadful lives
 Harshly darkness quietly surrounds the broken souls
 Mellow serenades that once played between hearts
 Pathetically have transformed into bitter sad songs.

Somewhere beyond the flossy clouds
 Cupid has lost his romancing arrows
 Plays sad sonorous tunes on his bow
 Dedicated to all weepy lonely hearts.

Howling chilly wind blows through the mist
 Sounds of sorrow spread all over the place
 Fuzzy humid air submerges the inner lust
 Lives decay slowly as the autumn leaves fall.
