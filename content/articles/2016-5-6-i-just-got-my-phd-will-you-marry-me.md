Adorable or terrible? At Wednesdayâ€™s postgraduate graduation ceremony a student who, judging from his gown, had just completed a PhD, proposed to his girlfriend onstage at the Royal Albert Hall. Cameras are set up that project close ups of those crossing the stage up onto a screen behind it for the audience to see. After shaking hands with the President, each student has their moment in the sun, where their post-graduation faces are shown on the big screen for all to see. Some choose to smile embarrassedly, while braver students will dane to do a thumbs-up or peace sign. This unnamed student whipped out a sign and a comically large engagement ring. How do you follow that? Judging from the scenes outside, Sharon said yes.
