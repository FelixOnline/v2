__Missing Women__
 After being accused of spying on employees in France, Ikea has issued an apology concerning its catalogue available in Saudi Arabia. In the Saudi version of the catalogue, women have been airbrushed out of pictures, including a woman standing in her pyjamas and an Ikea designer. Members of the Swedish government in particular were very critical of the multinational group, stating that companies should not abandon their values abroad. Saudi Arabia has been in the spotlight for women’s rights (or lack thereof), as women do not yet have the right to vote, and it is the only country in the world where women are not allowed to drive.

__Synchronised Toilet Flush__
 Citizens of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, have been asked to participate in a synchronised toilet flush. The aim is to prevent blockage of sewage pipes by keeping them wet. This has been difficult due to a prolonged drought and water shortages. Authorities have warned that residents who fail to flush their toilet at the designated time and date will risk being fined. The first flush took place at 17:30 GMT, 24th September 2012. Two synchronised toilet flushes have been scheduled every week from now on.

__Train Wreck__

The Department for Transport has gone back on its decision of giving FirstGroup the west coast mainline contract. When the contract was awarded during the summer, it was met with cries of protest from Richard Branson and Virgin, the west coast’s current operator. Branson claimed FirstGroup’s bid was unreasonably high and service quality would deteriorate or lead to a similar crisis as that of the east coast mainline, which was subsequently nationalised. The decision was finally scrapped last week by the government, explained by flaws in the bidding process and calculation mistakes. The blame has been placed on civil servants, including three who have been suspended. The government is now faced with two difficult challenges. The bidding process has been shown to be complicated and flawed, it will most likely need to be abandoned or reformed. In addition, Virgin Trains’ contract ends on 9th December; the route will have to be nationalised or an agreement will have to be reached with Virgin until a new bidding process can go through. The blunder has cost taxpayers £40million and is estimated to cost another £75million for every year the new contract is delayed. FirstGroup has stated it is considering legal action.
