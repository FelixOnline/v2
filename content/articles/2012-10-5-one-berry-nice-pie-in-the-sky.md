Berry Pie
 (Modified recipe from Chloe’s Kitchen)

The crust
 2.5 cups plain flour
 1 tbsp sugar
 1 tsp salt
 1 cup cold margarine cut in small cubes 1⁄2 cup ice cold water

The filling
 4 cups berries
 1⁄4 cup plain flour
 1 tsp cinnamon
 1⁄2 cup sugar
 Milk for brushing
 Sugar for sprinkling

Procedure:
 Preheat the oven at 180°C.
 Lightly grease a 9-inch pie pan. In a medium bowl mix flour, sugar, and salt. Using a knife cut the margarine into the flour mixture until you get a crumbly consistency. Then, add the cold water 1 tbsp at a time and mix. Add water until the dough just holds. Be careful not to overwork the dough otherwise you will get a very hard crust. Separate the dough in 2 pieces and place it in the refrigerator. After half an hour, remove the first piece from the refrigerator and roll it out until it is 1/8 inch thick. Fit the dough in the pan and refrigerate for 10 minutes. Then, make the filling by mixing all the ingredients and fill the piecrust. Similarly, roll out the second piece of dough and place it on top of the filling. Brush the pie with milk and sprinkle with sugar. Bake for about 55 minutes or until the pie is nicely browned.
