This work is a challenge to conventional portrayals of childhood. I want to ask questions about the identity of my subjects, and to analyze their personalities. By using both staged and observed portraits, I manipulate the images in order to achieve paradoxical character and an interplay between fiction and reality, suggestions and expectations.
