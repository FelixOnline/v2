This work is a challenge to conventional portrayals of childhood. I want to ask questions about the identity of my subjects, and to analyze their personalities. By using both staged and observed portraits, I manipulate the images in order to achieve paradoxical character and an interplay between fiction and reality, suggestions and expectations.

_Originally from Hungary, Zoltan Varga studied Documentary Photography at the University of Wales, Newport. His work is based mainly in Britain and Eastern Europe, and focuses on social and political issues. He currently works at Imperial._
