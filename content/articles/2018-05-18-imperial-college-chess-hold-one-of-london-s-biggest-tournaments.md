One of London’s biggest chess tournaments is hosted right here at Imperial, and organised by its number one sports club, IC Chess. The most recent edition kicked off on Friday 20th­ April, finishing on Sunday 22nd.

The weekend got off to a good start, with League Captain Ben Nevett conceiving of a novel table-arrangement to maximise the hall’s capacity, blowing the minds of all present and casting doubt on the necessity of years of turning players away from supposedly full tournaments.
Round one opened to an entry list of 95 in the Union Concert Hall. Organisation was led by alumnus John Sargent, and play officiated by the legendary FIDE International Arbiter Adam Raoof. Entrants were split into three sections (Minor, Major, and Open) based on ability, with five rounds to separate them.

This edition saw the club’s President-elect FIDE Master Aron Teh, incumbent Thomas Donaldson, VP Francesco Salerno, and esteemed-member Aluna Rizzoli brave the Open section, with shock-entrant superstar (formerly ninth in the world rankings) and prolific author Grandmaster John Nunn, raising the average rating of the section substantially. International Master Richard Bates and two-time Bangladeshi Woman’s Champion Akter Shamima rounded off a remarkably strong tournament (much to the author’s dismay).

The President started off well but saw his performance rapidly combust and crash in a microcosm of his academic career at Imperial, failing to convert against WIM Shamima and then losing to a welcome visitor from France, Jules Brunier.

Aron suffered a shock defeat in round one, before storming into third place with a streak of four ruthless wins—including one over Aluna, who held onto two points out of five. Rock-solid as ever, Francesco ended his time on the committee on a high with two wins, two draws, and a single loss. First place was shared by Dr Nunn and IM Bates, surprising no-one, after they paused their respective massacres of the opposition to agree a quick draw in round four.

For another incredibly smooth weekend, we’d like to thank: Kristie Thacker and the SAC team for providing the venue and access to the SAC kitchen; Adam Raoof for taking up the mantle of Chief Arbiter; John Sargent for returning as Chief Organiser again and doing everything that title entails.

This is IC Chess signing out for the year, we look forward to seeing you all again in October!
