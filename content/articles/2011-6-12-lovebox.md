If you’re looking for a festival with big names in central London, it doesn’t get any better than Lovebox. Set in the lovely Victoria Park in Hackney, [Lovebox](http://www.lovebox.net) brings together some of today’s most popular artists, and all within cycling distance of Imperial.

The winner of 2008’s Best Medium Sized Festival award, London’s premier three-day-long musical extravaganza has become an essential part of London’s summer calendar, and has previously played host to Dizzee Rascal, Roxy Music, Groove Armada and Grace Jones, among others, and this year promises to be the best yet.

Friday features dubstep giant Skream alongside Metronomy, Ed Sheeran, The Wombats, and a huge list of other big artists in an extremely diverse starting day.

On Saturday, Snoop Dogg, Jessie J,The Drums and Santigold grace the stage while Sunday features Scissor Sisters, 2ManyDJs, Robyn, Beth Ditto (from The Gossip) and Blondie on tour for their recent album Panic of Girls.

But Lovebox is about more than just the music. Information about this year’s entertainment is yet to be released, but 2009 featured a treehouse, a vintage fashion fair and a “healing and massage centre,” so expect great fun even when your favourite artists aren’t performing on stage.

Lovebox has been described simultaneously as the “trendiest”, “most authentic”, and “most convincing” festival in the country, so if you want the best festival experience around without spending huge amounts on transport and accommodation, Lovebox is the festival for you.

Tickets are available at [www.ticketmaster.co.uk.](http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/packages/lovebox_2011.html) Day tickets sell for £30 for Friday and £50 for Saturday or Sunday, but a well-spent £100 will get you access to an entire weekend’s worth of music.
