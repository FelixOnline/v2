     Just a quick clarification: The 'current budget' is a draft I wrote, not something that has been agreed by the Union. I asked Felix not to mention any draft budgets yet as they still need to be agreed internally, it's just what *I* am proposing happens...,talk dirty with me looking for the lady to a weomns dating s well as talk dirty even though I jack awa meet locals for sex y. black teen , zip 13854, 19484 horny divorced women want adult entertainment,　( 2012.02.23 16:55 ) : Do you mind if I quote a couple of your posts as long as I<a href="http://jwcryhwtn.com"> pidrvoe</a> credit and sources back to your weblog?

A meeting of the Ents Working Group, chaired by [Stefan Nubert, Deputy President (Finance & Services)](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/your-union/your-representatives/sabbatical-officers/stefan-nubert), is due to be held on Friday 1 February at 12:30 – 1:30 pm. The group is set to convene in order to consolidate a budget for future events orchestrated by Ents, including the prospective 2013 Summer Ball. All students are welcome to attend and sit in session. A draft budget is said to have been written but is open to modification (barring meeting charges). Students attending the session are invited to have an active input and submit any suggestions as appropriate. Budget finalisation will take place over the coming month of February. The current draft budget hopes to give a bar tab of over £22,000.

_[As mentioned in a comment by Paul Beaumont, Union President, and stressed in communications, the "current budget" referred to is just a draft and not set in stone. Felix apologises for not making this clear - Tim]_
