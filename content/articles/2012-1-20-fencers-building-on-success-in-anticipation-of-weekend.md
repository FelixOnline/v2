On Wednesday, the Women’s 2nd Fencing Team played, and won, the fifth competition in their league, leaving them in third place with a total of three wins and two losses. The competition was the first one of the term, and saw a confident team facing Portsmouth’s First Team at home.

The match began with foil, in which Jenifer Mizen (Jenny), Stephanie Martinez (Steph) and Elanor Oakley (Elsa) fought valiantly. The lead fluctuated between the two teams, with the scores remaining close until Jenny gained 10 points in one match, disheartening the other team and giving a lead of 8 points, which Steph and Else improved upon to win 45-35.

Following foil the team fenced sabre, during which Helen Pennington, Slavina Georgieva (Slavi) and Jing Quek (Jingles) did not lose a single match, winning 45-29. Finally, with their opponents thoroughly disheartened, and only needing 19 points to win, the women’s team fenced epee. Rebecca Razzey (Becky), Helen and Slavi only lost one out of the nine matches between them, and defeated their opponents 45-35, giving Imperial a triple-weapon-win with a total score of 135-99 - Portsmouth had not even managed to reach triple figures.
