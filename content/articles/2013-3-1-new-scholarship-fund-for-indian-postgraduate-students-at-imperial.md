Indian alumni and Imperial College London are launching a programme of new PhD scholarships for Indian postgraduates. The scholarships will be available to those who have a degree from an Indian institute and are in financial need. The website states that “priority will be given to who have not already completed a degree at a higher education institution outside India.”

For 2013 entry, College are inviting applications for PhD study in the Faculty of Engineering of the Business School.

President & Rector, Sir Keith O’Nions, said: “Imperial is proud to have an association with India and Indian higher education institutions which goes back many decades. The generosity of our Indian alumni, in supporting gifted postgraduates through these new scholarships, helps us build on this for the future.”

The scholarships were established with the Imperial College India Foundation in January during Sir Keith O’Nions’ visit to India.
