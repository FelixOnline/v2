I received [this book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Teach-Quantum-Physics-Your/dp/1851687793) as a Christmas present, probably as a humorous allusion to my ineptitude at physics. The premise is very simple: Emmy the dog is adopted by Orzel, a physics Professor, and subsequently becomes enraptured with his work and how it applies to everyday dog issues. Orzel is happy to explain, creating a witty dialogue between the two.

Using Emmy’s tendency to chase squirrels and her attempts to tunnel into the neighbour’s garden, Orzel takes the reader through the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, from Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle to quantum tunnelling, quarks and gluons. I expected a simplistic overview of the subject but the book is surprisingly comprehensive, using the relationship between dog and owner to breathe some life into what can sometimes be a dry subject. Orzel writes succinctly and with a genuine passion for the physics which is reflected in Emmy’s enthusiasm, providing a highly readable and novel way of approaching quantum physics.
