The Secret life of Walter Mitty is a Ben Stiller film based on the short of the same name written by James Thurber for the New Yorker in 1942.

In the film Stiller plays the titular character, Walter Mitty, a simple man in a niche job, born into a grey suit.

The story follows Mitty as he falls for a new co-worker, Cheryl (played by Kristen Wiig) and evolves from a man who daydreams about doing things to a man who actually steps out of his shell and taking a grip on the handlebars of life.

Mitty works as a low-level employee at a magazine before adapting to the changes brought in by the new, modern management team.

As the film progresses, Walter leaves the comfort of his home to travel further afield, learning more about himself while trying to find an elusive character that he’s never met in person.

The cinematography in the film provides a rather stark surreal experience that adds to the overall feeling of the film. As the character develops the scenery reflects changes the terrain.

The film explores themes of romance, corporate life and online dating (via gratuitous mentions of OK Cupid) over the course of the film, with Walter becoming more of an explorer and less of a basement dweller (something I can sympathise with - Ed.).

The film also explores the relationship Walter has with his mother and his sister; two characters that provide useful plot devices in unexpected parts of the script. The audience also sees Walter’s inexplicably spry skills on a skateboard, while showing tricks to Cheryl’s son in a park (or a stunt man – if you believe in those kind of things).

Overall, Stiller has produced a warm, feel-good, philosophical film with some amazing cinematography, a healthy dose of good guys and bad guys.

However, for people who are looking for an intellectual, action-packed movie, it might be time to look somewhere else...
