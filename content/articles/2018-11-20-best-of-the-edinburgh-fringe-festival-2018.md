**Linda**

Seated in a cosy Underbelly venue, we are told the story of Linda, an average 57-year-old woman who is selected to travel to Mars. We hear not from Linda herself; instead her story is told through the people around her, showing us some of the challenges she faced and revealing why she might want to leave her town in the first place…
I wasn’t quite sure what to expect from a one-woman show, but comedian Freya Slipper did not disappoint. Her impressions are uncanny and amusing, from a disorganised Spanish Zumba teacher to a blundering politician nodding her way through a television interview. These caricatures, though absurd at times, are highly relatable and consequently very entertaining. Favourite moments include side-splittingly funny audience participation, a disastrous episode at Brownies, and voicemails from demanding children (as I said, relatable – sorry Mum!) The overall message celebrates simple kindnesses by ordinary people, who put their own dreams to one side to help those around them. We all know a Linda. #GetLindaToMars

**Enter the Dragons**

This play is all about the ageing woman, examining societal pressures and making sense of them through the form of a mythical quest in pursuit of Kronos, who represents ageing. As we journey through mystical lands we encounter a number of quirky characters, from Sirens in the Sea of Apology, to Seers who give advice and help to guide us towards our destination.
We face a number of challenges, from sorting items of luggage that are too heavy to cross the Bridge of Tears, to solving confusing riddles and escaping mad doctors. Do we make it to meet Kronos? And what does he have to say for himself when we meet him face to face? You’ll have to find out yourself. And as winner of the Best Show at the Brighton Fringe 2018, it’s definitely worth a watch.

**Hot Gay Time Machine**

Queuing with my ticket, I hear a commotion behind me. “Out of the way, V. I. Gay coming through.” Turning around I see two hot, gay men pushing their way through a delighted crowd. After the success of their award-winning Fringe debut musical Six, creators Zak Ghazi-Torbati and Toby Marlow are back with Hot Gay Time Machine. The double act exude energy from start to finish, joking, dancing, and singing their way through this highly enjoyable cabaret. 
Self-conscious in the best kind of way, the boys use their time machine to take us back to moments in their lives, from making friends at university to coming out to their mums. Along the way they explore – through music – a variety of topics such as identity and consent, balancing serious messages perfectly with moments of genius comedy such that the final product leaves you reflective, uplifted and entertained. With their crowd-pleasing numbers, effort to include the whole audience (even passing the Bechdel Test…), and clear adoration for Beyoncé, you can’t help but love this show. Sensational.

**Craicling**

If you enjoy sketch comedy, then Foil, Arms and Hog are the Irish trio for you. Their highly polished sketches had me in stitches, interspersed with seemingly ad-lib impressions and improvisations which were a hit with the audience. From lessons on how to hold a baby, to a day in the life of a monk, Foil, Arms and Hog find comedy in all walks of life. I’d love to take them home and introduce them to me Mam but in the meantime, I’ll have to make do with their Facebook videos. Look ‘em up!
