Imperial College London’s Faculty of Engineering has been awarded a rare honour from Her Majesty the Queen to mark the Diamond Jubilee. The title is Regius Professor, and only two have been awarded in the past 100 years.

This year, twelve entries were awarded this title. Originally six were planned, but the judges deemed entries “exceptionally high” and therefore more entries were successful. Chloe Smith, UK Political and Constitutional Reform minister, said: “I have been bowled over by the response from universities. The submissions we received were incredibly strong which is why we advised the Queen to create twice as many Regius Professorships than originally planned.”

The Queen approves all of the appointments, with ministers advising her. The full list of universities where the twelve created positions are is as follows: Imperial College, London for engineering; London School of Economics for economics; Open University for open education; University of Manchester for physics; Royal Holloway at University of London for music; University of Essex for political science; King’s College London for psychiatry; University of Reading for meteorology and climate science; University of Southampton for computer science; University of Surrey for electronic engineering; University of Dundee for life sciences; and University of Warwick for mathematics.

_[UPDATE: The title will go to Professor Chris Toumazou FRS and FREng, from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering_

_UPADATE: Department of Engineering refers to the Faculty of Engineering. This has been fixed in the above text. Thanks to "Anonymous" if that is your real name, which most would doubt it actually is.]_
