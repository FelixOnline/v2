And so this is Christmas. The season of merriment, mulled wine, and all-too-predictable disappointment. You were probably expecting the album of the week, given that it is the season of cheer, to be __Michael Bublé__’s _Christmas_; if so, I’m sorry to disappoint. You may have expected it to be __The Black Keys__’ latest release _El Camino_; if so not only am I sorry to disappoint, but I’m also extremely disappointed myself – the album is a bit of a dud. Given the overwhelming ubiquity of disappointment, I thought it better to simply embrace it. To welcome the ennui, loneliness, and introspection that accompanies the monotonous sounds of Christmas – Jesus Christ, __Leona Lewis__, you’ve been bleeding for almost four years now, die already!

Hence, [__Vondelpark __](http://open.spotify.com/album/3MLWKgHU6kocVS9hhtjEUN)[Spotify]. This Surrey/London trio have crafted a solemn and secretive sound that gives little away. I’m pretty sure they’re feeling low and nostalgic, but I’ve no idea what about – although I’d guess from their sublime opener ‘TV’ they’re sad that Community has left our screens. If you’re going through a breakup, or agonizing over an un-requited love, I advise you to steer well clear; their cracked, sensitive beats are ripe for recording and amplifying your emotions.

I’d file them next to __Baths__, or __Balam Acab__. I’d probably also file them in the BBC’s Sound of 2012, but obviously the BBC disagree. December is the time for putting albums in lists and ‘predicting’ next year’s trends. [None is more controversial](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/neilmccormick/100049586/bbcs-sound-of-2011-poll-should-be-treated-with-caution/) than the [BBC’s Sound of Whatever-Year-Is-Next](http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/soundof/2012/artists/). This time around, alongside the brilliant [__Azealia Banks__](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3Jv9fNPjgk), the [violent-but-talented](http://www.ozonemag.com/2011/10/22/asap-rocky-destroys-fader-fort-stage-in-nyc-sends-stage-hand-to-er/)[__A$AP Rocky__](http://felixonline.co.uk/music/1776/kadhims-totally-hot-album-of-the-week-7/), and __Frank Ocean__, they’ve chosen destroyer-of-all-that-is-good __Skrillex__: a man who looks and sounds like he’s from a dystopian future where Putin and __Lady Gaga __terrorise the Earth in a brutal transvestite, brostep tyranny.
 But I shouldn’t complain. It’s Christmas after all. It’s not a time to hate… it’s a time to feel bitter and depressed. Enjoy Vondelpark.
