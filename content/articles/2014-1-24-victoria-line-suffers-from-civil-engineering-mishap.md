The Victoria line on Thursday 23 January was partly suspended with severe delays for several hours due to fast-setting concrete. Trains were not running between Warren Street and Brixton.

Nigel Holness, the director of London Underground said: "This afternoon our contractors were working on the new station in an area next to the Victoria line signal control room. These works involved the use of water and cement which leaked into the room, damaging equipment. This has meant there are no signals working on the southern section of the line. Our engineers are working hard to resolve the situation as soon as possible to get services back up and running, but the line is expected to be affected for the remainder of the day while repairs are carried out."
