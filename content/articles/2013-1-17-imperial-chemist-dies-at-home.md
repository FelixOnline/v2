I knew Joachim for the last 23 years having done our PhD’s together at the University of Strathclyde under Professor David’s Sherrington’s fine leadership.

Joachim was the “crazy” German guy. It was an incredibly intense but marvellously fun time of our lives. The overwhelming thing that struck you about Joachim was that he was always utterly, madly enthusiastic and passionate about chemistry, but he really, really loved his own discipline – polymers. He would gabble on for hours and hours about twiddling this and altering that part of the polymer and would then turn and ask me what effect it would have on the outcome of the polymer structure. To which I would often reply “I’ve absolutely no idea”. I shared a flat with him for a long time during that period and learnt all about his silly foibles – his obsessions with Macintosh mugs, bits of bicycles, awful fondues and Birkenstocks – all the things that made him somuch of a colourful character.

After this, we both went our separate ways he went to US, to join Fréchet’s group at Cornell and then returning to Cambridge whilst I went to Japan, still keeping in touch over email. Serendipitously, after our post-doc’s we both started at the same time at Imperial College. He hadn’t changed. He was full of exuberance and fun, full of stupendous ideas, rich in their ludicrousness, but at the same time they had sparkles of brilliance flecked through them. That was a very difficult time of my life and I simply cannot say how helpful and generous he was to me during that time.

Joachim always expected the highest standards from himself and others. He was a true scholar in the real sense of the word; leaving no stone unturned in pursuit of the truth. He was exceedingly well read and knowledgably about a vast range of subjects both, within chemistry and beyond, and would severely chastise anyone who was not as well prepared as him. I fear that many a research proposal wilted under that fearsome gaze. He had a formidable intellect and was incredibly generous as an individual giving his time endlessly to any student or anyone else who needed help. He was exceedingly selfless in this regard.

Joachim really grew to love this country that became his home and all things British – the good bits and the bad. He had a great sense of humour, and he genuinely loved the “British” way of looking at the world. He really loved life, he loved his food and loved a good wine.

God-parent to my son, ex-flat mate, intellectual giant and the best friend a man could ever have, he will be very sorely missed by one and all, but especially by me.

He leaves his long-term partner, Natasha and my thoughts are with her at this time.

_This obituary was written by Dr Rob Law from the Department of Chemistry at Imperial College London. Dr Law was Dr Steinke’s oldest and best friend._

_Dr Steinke died suddenly last Tuesday. The death is not being treated as suspicious. The cause of death was most likely a heart attack. His funeral will be held in Germany._
