Every year, as Christmas nears, I would like to think that I have some really rich and wealthy relative who is a Lord somewhere, perhaps some Lord of the Silicon. I would then write up a list of five items I would really like to have and then present it to them, knowing that I would probably get almost all of the items on the list that very Christmas. So this year, I am going to do the same. To help those busy Lords out, I’m going to list the prices of the items in my list, just to show them how little it would cost them. Of course, because they are so busy, I would like to help them out by including the prices from Amazon UK too, so that they could just click those “1-click order” buttons and send them my way.

#### __Asus PQ321QE 31.5 inch Widescreen LCD Monitor__

Well, isn’t this a beauty: this 31.5 inch TV sitting on a desk is capable of displaying a resolution of 3840 by 2160 pixels (4K) is simply a marvel.It is also the first of its kind for the consumer market. Anandtech calls this a display that has “ left [them] in constant awe over how incredible it was to use on a day-to-day basis”. Definitely a must have when trying to write all those thousand lines C++ code projects. Those pesky missing semicolons will now be displayed in glorious 4K.

#### __nVidia GeForce GTX Titan Graphics Card__

Of course, if you have such a gorgeous display, you also need something really good to drive the display. Always looking for the best, the new nVidia flagship would just about suffice. Once again, because I am too poor to actually get one of these gems, I would have to turn to Anandtech who calls this graphics card is “simply in a league of its own right now, reaching levels of performance no other single-GPU card can touch”.

#### __Sony NEX7 Mirrorless Camera__

When you’ve got a setup as gorgeous as mine (eventually, after Christmas!), you’ve got to capture the moment with a good camera so that you can broadcast it to the world via Facebook, Twitter, and the likes! What better way than to use the Sony NEX7 camera. It’s a mirrorless camera that allows for interchangeable lens. It’s one of those compact DSLR cameras that you could potentially fit into a small bag.

#### __Crucial M500 960 GB Solid State Drive__

I write lots of code, perhaps GB worth of code on my computer (don’t even ask how many lines of code there are). Of course I would need something to store those tons of code -- and the 960 GB SSD is the best that money can buy right now! With a cost of nearly £0.60 per GB, the SSD prices have never been any lower for this reliable medium.

####

#### __UE 9000 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones__

Finally, when writing code, I would like to immerse myself in the world of digital music. I hate wires getting in the way, and the Ultimate Ears (UE) 9000 headphones is probably the best bluetooth headphones you can get out there on the market. The noise cancellation and audio profile on this thing might not be perfect, but it is one of the most expensive right now.
