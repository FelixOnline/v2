Next Wednesday members of College staff and construction managers will meet in the Union Dining Hall to provide feedback on the progress of the construction of new halls of residence, in Acton.

The meeting, attended by Jane Neary, Director of Campus Services; Paul Noke, Head of Residential Services and GradPad; and Toni Byrne-Price, Project Director from Berkley First, gives students the chance to provide input on the project’s final design stage, which will affect the use of some of the spaces and the look and feel of the new residence.

The new hall, currently referred to as “One Victoria Road”, was the target of a student campaign last year against the creation of a large halls of residence in North Acton, will be located approximately five miles from campus and is expected to house upto 700 undergraduate students.

The halls are expected to be complete by the end of next academic year, providing bed spaces to replace those removed by the potentially temporary closure of Evelyn Gardens (as reported by Felix in March) at the end of the 2014-15 academic year. The meeting will take place on Wednesday 4th June at 5:00PM at the Union Dining Hall, and light refreshments will be provided.
