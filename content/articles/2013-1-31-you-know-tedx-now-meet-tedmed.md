Fresh from the excitement of last year’s incredibly successful TEDx event, those great TED vibes return to Imperial College once more, this time bringing with them [TEDMEDLive](http://www.tedmed.com/event/tedmedlive).

[TEDMED](http://www.tedmed.com/) is a community of the brightest minds interested in overcoming the world’s most pressing medical and health challenges. Oncea year they congregate in Washington, DC to bring to bear the latest thinking and research into a diverse range of fields surrounding the human condition, but don’t be tricked into thinking TEDMED is of interest only to medics.

The four day conferences are extremely multidisciplinary, combining talks and presentations with performances from artists, poets and musicians. Highlights from past TEDMED conferences include David Blaine telling a room full of medical professionals how he continually defied the advice of doctors in his pursuit to break the record for holding one’s breath under water, and illusionist Eric Mead demonstrating the complex power of the placebo with nothing but a piece of cutlery. These talks alone demonstrate the amazing accessibility to medical insight and innovation a TEDMED event affords its audience.

However, until this year, to be in a live TEDMEDaudience required a trip to the States. All that has now changed as it was revealed today that a license has been obtained to hold ‘TEDMEDLive at Imperial College’, a sister event to the conference in DC, the first of its kind outside the US.

From April 16-19 TEDMEDLive Imperial College will feature streams from stateside as well as a programme of live speakers, performers and workshops. All these will be presented under the overarching mission to ‘Combine the nexus of health, information and technology with compelling personal stories and glimpses into the future of healthcare and medicine’. Although many of the details have yet to be revealed, the event is expected to celebrate the contributions of Imperial College and the UK as a whole to the advancement of medicine and healthcare and is expected to be a big draw due to it’s unique European location.

Ticket prices are expected to be announced in the following days, but the organising committee has confirmed that a proportion of tickets will be made exclusively available to Imperial students at a lower price to make the event as widely available as possible.

More details are expected in the coming days and weeks. Discover them first on the TEDMEDLive at Imperial blog, found here: [www.TEDMEDLiveImperial.com](http://www.TEDMEDLiveImperial.com).
