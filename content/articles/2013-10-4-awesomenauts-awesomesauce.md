For a long time Awesomenauts had a lonely existence in my Steam library. I picked it up in a sale and then there it sat unplayed. One day prompted by fellow editor Max I finally played it and realised the mistake I had made! Straight from the opening titles I knew I would love this game so sit tight for my “AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!” review.
 Awesomenauts is a side-scrolling multiplayer battle game developed and published by Ronimo games. This is a game unlike any I have played before, but immediately I am a fan. The premise is that you are a mercenary hired by a drilling company to mine solar. However another drilling company has also hired mercenaries so it quickly escalates into a battle for control. It combines strategy with some real time fights, and does so successively. In each battle the goal is to destroy the turrets of the other team, with your 3 teammates, while defending your turrets. Drones are also spawned to help you out. As you destroy and kill the other team you will earn solar which you can use to upgrade your character. Once the turrets have been destroyed you work to destroy the drill core of the other team which wins the game for your team.

There is a short tutorial which teaches you the basics, after that you can choose to play against AI, but the real fun is online. Finding a game is short! I hardly had to wait anytime at all. The game gives you a lot of options for personalisation. From choosing your character (and skins that you can purchase for them) to special abilities you will be able to spend solar on in the game you can really find that perfect combination that works for you. Completing games earns you XP which enables you to level up which unlocks more characters, options for your characters and maps. This helps you to not feel overwhelmed at the beginning by all the options. As you learn by playing games you also get better characters and more options. Besides all this levelling up is always a satisfying experience. Visually Awesomenauts is a very pretty cartoony game. The music, also great, helps to give it a kids TV battle programme kind of theme which really works well!
 Where this game really stood out for me was playing with your friends. Three people on each team means you can easily get two other people to game with you and this will provide hours of fun. I enjoyed a very eventful session of being shouted at on Skype, sadly a game experience I am used to when playing with this particular friend, while being killed in increasingly embarrassing ways. It doesn’t matter whether you are winning or losing, Awesomenauts is always hilarious. Even when my keyboard broke I was able to keep playing thanks to the controller support. Playing with a controller is intuitive and easy despite the fact that aiming is done with the same controls as walking. I’m not usually a fan of multiplayer battle games but Awesomenauts is both casual enough for me and competitive enough for my critical friend that we both enjoyed it.
 I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a fun multiplayer experience. It’s a great game to have for just killing 30 minutes here and there or for an evening of fun. For the price of £6.99 this game is a steal!
