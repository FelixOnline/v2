Thanks to [David from yesterday](http://felixonline.co.uk/music/1238/london-student-vs-felix-day-three--a-song-that-makes-you-happy/#comment80000664) for this suggestion. Whichever way you interpret this song, it undoubtedly has the power to take you to that dark place where ex-girl/boyfriends, old friends, and missed opportunities reside.
