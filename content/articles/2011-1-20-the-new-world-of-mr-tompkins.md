I'm going to be a little self-indulgent this week, with a book that triggered my interest in physics. The new world of Mr Tompkins is a revised version of Gamowís classic, bringing the witty and engaging story of Mr Tompkins up to date with current physics. Taking the reader on a whirlwind tour through relativity, quantum mechanics, antimatter and black holes, Mr Tompkins provides an endearing medium for the authors to explain some complicated ideas. The physics is, of course, the backbone of the book but it reads like a novel, with Mr Tompkinsí plight for romance and love bringing the characters to life.

Gamow was one of the most significant physicists of the last century but also had a unique gift for popularising science; Stannard is equally prolific as a science communicator today. Between the two of them they are able to pull apart the foundations of physics and explain the intricacies whilst we watch them being put back together.
