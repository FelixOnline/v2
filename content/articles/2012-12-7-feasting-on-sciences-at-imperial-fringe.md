Following the success of last week’s [Imperial Fringe](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_30-11-2012-10-11-10) event focused on bone research taking place across the College, which was estimated to have gathered around 400 people throughout the evening with 120 people participating in the panel discussion, a new event called ‘A Feast of the Sciences’ is about to take place.

This month’s event includes a wide range of disciplines such as thermodynamics, biotechnology, agriculture, medicine and many others. Nevertheless, all of them are there to celebrate the festive spirit to create a true ‘Feast for the Sciences’.

The evening will start with the presentation of [Miss Cakehead](http://misscakehead.wordpress.com/), a renowned confectioner who’s famous for a variety of her works, including ‘Eat your heart out’ series of anatomically decorated edible arts. This time the audience will be delighted with a variety of Christmas dainties made of sponge and sugar. This will be followed by a great number of other yummy treats including ice cream out of a fire extinguisher presented by Professor in thermodynamics [Erich Muller](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/e.muller), honey from Imperial’s own hives located in the garden just behind Ethos and Alchemists Dreams offering to create and taste your own seasonal drinks.

On a more serious note, the speakers will touch upon the issues of food production including Imperial’s own fertilizing machine, its sustainability and security as well as health related food concerns such as obesity.

Event organiser Harriet Martin said: “A food and drink-themed Imperial Fringe at Christmas is the perfect seasonal way of introducing people to some of the College’s research. We hope that members of the Imperial community as well as external audiences will enjoy the exciting activities, as well as sampling some festive delights.”

The event is open to general public including, of course, Imperial students, and will take place on Thursday the 13 December 2012 at the Main Entrance of the South Kensington campus between 5 and 8 pm, however, everyone is free to come and go as please.
