Wednesday’s Varsity Hockey matches saw mostly college wins over the medics. With four games played at Harlington, Hockey took place two weeks earlier than Football and Rugby, which are on the 19th at Heston.

The IC women’s 2s had a monstrous 8-0 win over the medics, and were 3-0 up just 14 minutes into the match.

The Men’s 1s match was a close one, with scores equal throughout much of the game. Eventually IC pulled through and earned a 3-2 victory, partially on p-flicks.

Medics triumphed in the Ladies’ 1s game, winning 4-3 on penalties after equalising on 4-4.

The Men’s 2s and 3s matches both ended in 1-0 victories for the college teams.
