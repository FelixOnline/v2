_Hi there,_

*

_I am a bin_

_Your humble biographer_

_Wherever I may be_

_Beside the kitchen sink yawning in the morning to catch your cereal packet or an unwashed peanut butter jar_

*

_Standing on the landing at University you pass me everyday occasionally greet me with a screwed up tissue._

*

_At lunchtime I watch open-mouthed as you forage fridges of film-wrapped sandwhiches._

_Waste. Produce of haste._ 

*

_You haven’t seen what my grown-up brothers do who graduated into industry
or work at the supermarkets on the night-shift._

*

_Finished lunch. Yum - a wooden fork and knife._

_At last something but plastic._

_Though they’re not going to biodegrade_

_In a rubbish dump sealed anaerobically._

*

_I have a cousin. He’s a bit of a hippie._

_Got his head dyed green._

_Thinks he can take most things_

_Calls himself a recycling bin_

_He sends two-thirds of his earnings overseas
for developing nations to deal with._

*

_Evening. Black Friday._

_You come in with a discounted ready meal_

_I feel a fuzzy feeling, like a stocking on Christmas day._

*

_I am tired_

_But there is no time for rest_

_Many miles away_

_Oceans churn_

_Incinerators burn_

_My belly ends and landfill begins._
