This Tuesday, it was Imperial’s turn to host the Imperial vs. UCL gaming tournament. The room was packed, so I was expecting fierce fighting from both sides. Instead, I was met with familiar faces at every turn. In fact, about 80% of the room were Imperial students, from what I’ve heard.

My spies, have mentioned that there’s a bunch of deadlines for UCL students this week and that’s why they didn’t turn up. Looks like there was a slight fail over in the communications department. Expect a rescheduling.
