Imperial College Business School removed some of the content used as course material, following a complaint made by a student that it “referred to women in an offensive way”.

The video, which was used in a Managerial Economic module, was taken down earlier this week, with students being informed of the decision on the 4th December. The video in question was from the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind, and featured a group of men using game theory to ensure that they “all get laid”; mathematician John Nash (Russell Crowe) advises his friends that if they “all go for the blonde” then “not a single one of us is going to get her.” It was used as an attempt to explain the Nash Equilibrium, a concept in game theory.

In an email from Francisco Veloso, the Dean of the Business School, he told students he “agreed with the assessment [of the complaint], and had it replaced immediately.”

Speaking to _Felix_, Fintan O'Connor, Deputy President (Welfare), said that he was “pleased that the College has taken a strong stance on the content it deems appropriate for a teaching environment”, but highlighted that he was “even more pleased by the example it shows – that a single student student can challenge unacceptable behaviour, and make a difference to Imperial’s culture for the better.” 

Veloso similarly stated that the student coming forward was “an attitude and form of behaviour that I would like to encourage among all our students and staff.”

In a statement, a College spokesperson said that they were “very sorry indeed for any offence caused. It is very much neither the culture nor the behaviour we aspire to at Imperial, and an apology has been sent to all students who saw the video.”

They went on to say that “as part of the new Learning and Teaching Strategy the Business School and the College are already developing a variety of initiatives to make our undergraduate and postgraduate curricula more inclusive in terms of both the research content and teaching, and we are also looking at our current procedures around how we handle complaints from students.”

Imperial has stated that, as part of their commitments to equality, they will “[create a culture where all staff and students feel valued and respected](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/equality/equality-at-imperial/)”.
