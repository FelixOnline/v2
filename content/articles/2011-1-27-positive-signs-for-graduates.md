A [poll by the Association of Graduate Recruiters](http://www.agr.org.uk/content/Brighter-outlook-for-graduates-as-vacancy-numbers-increase-for-first-time-since-recession-began) (AGR) of 222 recruiters in the UK reveals an 8.9% annual increase in graduate jobs, with a forecast of a further 3.8% increase for this year.

The survey indicates that salaries are likely to remain static. The average salary is predicted to stay at £25,000 for an unprecedented third year.

Carl Gilleard, chief executive of the AGR, stated: “What tended to happen in the past [recessions] is that employers put the brakes on, and only took their foot off a year or two later. Then they found they didn’t have the talent in their organisation to cope with growth. I think that was an important lesson that a lot of employers learned.”

Gilleard added: “It is heartening to see that after so many months of misery for graduates, the job market is finally picking up. These results signal that the graduate market is overcoming the impact of the recession and anticipating further growth.

“However, the fact that salaries are predicted to remain the same for a third year and fewer employers are offering financial incentives for graduates, is also evidence that the demand for jobs still greatly outstrips supply, and recruiters continue to receive above and beyond the number of applications they require.”

Universities Minister David Willetts said: “A degree remains a good investment in the long term and is one of the best pathways to achieving a good job and rewarding career.”
