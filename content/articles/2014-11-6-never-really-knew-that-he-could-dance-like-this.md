A_rabic Night_ is a monthly Middle Eastern dance showcase in central London and is a regular favourite of the Imperial College Belly Dancing Society. Last Sunday around 15 of us headed to the fancy Moroccan and Lebanese restaurant __Maison Touareg__, located in the heart of Soho.

After getting extra cosy with the other society members due to the lack of appropriate seating for the over-sold show, we tucked into various delicious mezze dishes. Let me tell you – there’s something rather satisfying about gorging yourself whilst watching professional dancers of all sizes athletically (yet still gracefully) twirl around an impossibly small stage.

The dancers themselves were not lacking in variety, with one coming all the way from Russia, others not so far away in Birmingham, and a few London circuit regulars. The acts were full of glitz, glam and sparkles, and offered a variety of Middle Eastern cultural references; from traditional _Baladi_ style to more modern Arabic pop music, with one dancer even pirouetting along to a song featuring Snoop Dogg! We were treated further with some wonderful Indian fusion belly dance from Monica and Heena, which was a lovely, introspective break from the cabaret spectacle of the previous dancers of the night, which I feel epitomised the sheer versatility of the London belly dancing community.

The night also featured live _tabla_ drummer Sallam, who could be seen skillfully tapping away all evening with a cheeky smile. He even provided the rhythm for several entertaining improvisational dances by Arabic Night organizer Sarah Malik, making the best of a potentially awkward situation when the sound system went down.

By far the most entertaining act of the night was Sunny the Snake Boy, male belly dancer and compère extraordinaire. His act involved dancing on the tables, stealing one belly dancing society member’s phone and shoving it down his skirt (yep, you read correctly!) and twerking on various members of the audience. He single-handedly whipped up a raucous atmosphere in the restaurant as he introduced each act, and he even challenged me to a belly-off in the interval. Belly Dance society members will be pleased to know that I did my best to compete!

_Arabic Night_ is an excellent way to get an authentic taste of Middle Eastern dance culture, and the atmosphere is that of a big welcoming family. I sincerely recommend this event for anyone looking for a fast track induction into the world of belly dancing. The evening was enjoyed by new and old members, and by men and women alike.

_The next Arabic Night will be held on the 14th December at Maison Touareg, Soho. For more info, contact the Belly Dancing Society at bellydancing@imperial.ac.uk_
