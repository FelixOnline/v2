Joining ESN this year has far exceeded any expectations. It has been so rewarding to be involved with hosting events and supporting our members, as well as being involved in national and international events with other committees from around Europe. This Easter I went to Thessaloniki, Greece, for the international AGM, and returned even more motivated to continue to be a part of ESN.

**Rufus Mitchell-Heggs - President**

Two years ago, I finished what must have been the craziest and most fun years of my life. In one short year, I discovered new places, new beers and made some amazing friends.

Since returning to Imperial, I joined as the ESN Imperial Vice-President and have had the pleasure of organising events alongside some of the most driven and energetic people. As a team of ex-Erasmus students, we have always aimed to enrich our incoming exchange student’s experience of both Imperial and London.  Furthermore, through ESN, I have had the opportunity to create international partnerships, participate in national platforms, attend an international AGM (>1000 student volunteers) and solidify Imperial’s position in something much greater.
