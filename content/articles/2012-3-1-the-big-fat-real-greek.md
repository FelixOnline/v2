_Many of you may feel a bit unwilling to visit a Greek restaurant because of Greece’s absurd and unjustifiable dealing of its politico-economic crisis. Besides, it is a fact, especially for those studying economics, that a country so small as Greece and with such a small and limited economy, can easily drag down healthy(?) economies such as America’s, the UK’s and Europe’s. However, we suggest you try to forget for a moment that all our problems’ source is Greece and enjoy some delicious food!_

__The Real Greek __is a modern restaurant chain found across London. It’s the ideal place for you and your friends to enjoy tasteful Greek and Mediterranean dishes in a relaxed environment.

We haven’t visited a Greek restaurant for a long time and our anticipation to taste everything on the menu was great. We decided very quickly though; “please bring us the standards”. As a starter we had the traditional Tzatziki – Real Greek is the only restaurant in London that makes it with garlic instead of mint, as we were told by the waiter – and Babaganoush, a light and fragrant blend of smoked aubergine, tahini and garlic, served with the necessary Greek flatbread.

As soon as the king of all dishes, the Greek Souvlaki, arrived, we were super-excited. It arrived accompanied with grilled Cypriot Halloumi cheese, pork sausage and delicious handmade pastry parcels with creamy leek, spinach and feta filling, known as Tiropitakia. It’s quite hard to explain with words, how few dishes combined with familiar music melodies and Thames waters can instantly take you back home. OK, the truth is that we simply can’t be unbiased in this review. But it’s a fact that the restaurant was literally packed, by people from various nationalities, who seemed to enjoy it as much as we did.

You might be wondering why we haven’t mentioned the Greek Salad yet. Well, we both think that this is a dish everyone should have on their table. You can never fully enjoy a Greek meal without having that unmistakable combination of tomato, cucumber, feta cheese, olives, olive oil and oregano in your plate. After all, it’s healthy!
