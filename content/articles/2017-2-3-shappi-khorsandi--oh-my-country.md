Shappi Khorsandi has lived in England for 40 years, and in Oh My Country!: from Morris Dancing to Morrissey she explains her Billy Bragg-inspired brand of patriotism: “it’s about places, not races”, she says, delivering anecdotes about skinheads in the 80s and racial abuse nowadays with a sense of nostalgia. Khorsandi is adamant about her identity being defined on her own terms, and refuses to be put in a box. She explains her aversion to her book, Nina is Not Okay, being nominated for an award dedicated to "Writers of Colour" – “I’m not a crayon!” she says, showing the audience an open letter she received in response to asking herself to be removed from the long list. Having been accused of “obscuring her identity”, she points at her face, and her book cover, on which her name is printed. She’s never had to justify her Iranian heritage, she says.

Her young children perfectly exemplify her dual culture: she paints a picture of her sarcastic son watching Countryfile, snacking on potted beef, while her dramatic three-year-old daughter calls it “dog food” and goes back to eating her sheep’s head. She brings out her passport onstage, telling the audience about a conversation with a twelve-year-old refugee in Calais who was so impressed she had a red one. She reads the front, and describes it as a “sick note from the Queen”. She rolls her eyes at Trump, and reflects on the absurdity of the idea of her satirist father, forced to flee death threats in Iran 40 years ago, not being allowed to travel to the US. Having delivered a speech at the rally the night before, she complains about having to come up with new material on such short notice.

All her material is delivered with charm and authenticity. It’s impossible to not be endeared when she notices some change by her feet and moves it off the stage. “It’s bad luck!” she explains, and asks the audience not to tell the British Humanist society, of which she is president. Khorsandi‘s natural charisma, combined with her original, politically-tinged material, add up to a show that is optimistic, and at times bittersweet.

Shappi Khorsandi's Oh My Country! is on at the Soho Theatre until 4th February. Tickets from £13.
