After the all round success seen at ArtsFest last term for the Arts societies Imperial has seen them come roaring back to life for a series of incredible Easter term concerts. ICSM Drama put on a wonderful performance of Midsummer Night’s dream in the Union Concert Hall last week with snazzy costumes, set and performances. The PhotoSoc exhibition has been up in the Blythe gallery since the launch last week and it’s pretty incredible. The free wine and cheese at the launch was also pretty incredible, if we’re being completey honest.

As we’ve already seen in Felix C&amp;S, there’s the Dance Imperial show coming up this weekend (17th -19th March) which is set to be a phenomenal six dance society collaboration. Also on this weekend we have the ICSE concert (mentioned above), Imperial’s Got Talent (20th March, Great Hall), and IC DramSoc’s Big Fellah (20th &amp; 21st  March, MR3). It’s going to be a big weekend of big talent!

Also coming up soon is the Imperial College Chamber Choir concert ‘Sacré et Profane’ in the Holy Trinity Church (22nd March) and ICSM Light Opera’s 24 (30th April) where the cast start learning a musical and perform it only 24 hours after being told what it is!
