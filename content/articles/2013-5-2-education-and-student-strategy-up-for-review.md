Imperial College London have created a paper on the future [Education and Student Experience strategy](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/educationoffice/strategy). Between now and Friday 10 May staff, students, and alumni are asked to give their views on the outcome. Views are being sought for actions proposed and on what to prioritise. To contribute online, go to the [website](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/educationoffice/strategy). There will also be two open meetings on 17 April from 13.00 -14.00 in the Read Lecture Theatre, Sherfield Building and on 25 April from 17.00-18.00 in the Clore Lecture Theatre, Huxley Building.

Professor Debra Humphris, who is heading up the strategy, said: “Your responses will inform a paper outlining the [Education and Student Strategy](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/3200/imperial-launches-education-and-student-strategy-survey/) and implementation plan which will be considered by Management Board in June and received by Council in July.” The Management Board is one of the highest Boards in College, and is chaired by the President & Rector. The College Council is ultimately responsible for College policy.

Humphris said: “I’m very grateful to those who contributed their time and ideas in the initial consultation. We received a wide range of responses from staff, students and alumni, not only through our online consultation but also at the open meetings and in discussion with student reps and sabbaticals.”
