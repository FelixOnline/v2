Following the interlude at the _Felix Music Night _last weekend, __Music Tech Society__ return to Metric next Saturday 26 November with their first We Are Metric night of the year. Given the Union’s new policy on clubs & societies requiring a special theme in order to host a night, what better way to welcome 2012 than naming it after one of the most widely misinterpreted biblical events of all time A.D.? Perhaps painting a van with slogans prophesying the End Times? (With stupid subwoofers in the boot perhaps?)

The Greek word apokálypsis literally means “lifting of the veil” or “revelation”, referring to the disclosure of something previously hidden in an age of deception. With the kind of music blaring through the radio and pummeling dancefloors at student nights nationwide, such a revelation in dance music is long overdue.

The night kicks off in left field with a psychotropic blend of experimental hip hop courtesy of __Not Indigo__, followed by __SMB__’s deep vibes. A variety of society members will hone their skills behind the turntables, with the intent of making you dance like it’s the end of the world. Livers and ears alike will teeter the abyss as the clock approaches the eleventh hour and the thunderous duo of __Snatch DJs__ (recently spotted at the Summer Ball after party) take the floor, followed by the chunky swagger of Milkshake-resident __Nick Thorne__. Ministry of Sound veterans __DJ Andy __& __Martin2Smoove__ crack the void at midnight and flip the switch.

Entry is a shabby £3 in advance or £4 on the door, discounted for members of Music Tech or anybody dressed like it’s the end of the world. That should be interesting.
