I love _Die Hard_. In fact, I’m one of those people who call it one of the best Christmas films of all time. The issue is that I am banned – as we all should be – from watching the film until at least the start of December. Until then, it looks like we need some other action films to fill the void:
## ___13 Assassins (2010)___
For the uninitiated, Japanese film-maker Takashi Miike is a lunatic. Debuting in 1991, Miike-san has now directed almost 100 films. But he doesn’t direct crap: _Audition_ and _Ichi the_ Killer are just two classics attributable to him. Also unmatched in his disturbing and gruesome content, in Miike’s _13 Assassins_ alone we see disembodiment, torture, seppuku, and child murder, to say nothing of the hordes of soldiers murdered by our main samurai cast. For plot, simply imagine _Seven Samurai_ meets _The Magnificent Seven_.
## ___Starship Troopers (1997)___
I don’t think there has ever been a film as misunderstood as _Starship Troopers_. It’s almost funny watching people praise the film for what it isn’t. Behind this seemingly meat-headed war flick is parody and commentary on the level of classics like _Dr Strangelove_. In this universe the humans are the fascist invaders – they’re basically wearing Nazi uniforms for God’s sake. The action set pieces are solid, but go into this movie looking for the right things and you’ll uncover a hidden depth.
## ___The Raid (2011)___
Oh God, is _The Raid_ good. I mean really good. Best-action-film-of-all-time good. In all honesty I don’t need a complex argument to explain why. The film features Iko Uwais, a real-life Indonesian Pencak Silat champion taking on countless drugged up gang members as he and his SWAT team ascend a tower block to reach a drug lord. The fighting is flawlessly choreographed and brutal, with every scene here surpassing what would be the main set piece other action films. Watch this, then watch _The Raid 2_, then go eat a steak to expel all that testosterone.
