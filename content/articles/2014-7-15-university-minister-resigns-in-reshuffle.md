Conservative MP David Willetts has resigned his post as Universities Minister as part of the current cabinet reshuffle. Mr Willetts was previously the Shadow Universities Minister and the Shadow Education Minister. His replacement will be Greg Clark.

Incumbent Education Minister Michael Gove has lost his post in a reshuffle that has already seen William Hague step down from his post as Foreign Secretary and Ken Clarke leave the cabinet. Mr Gove has been made Chief Whip and will be replaced by Nicky Morgan.

Mr Willetts will also be stepping down as a member of parliament next year in the general election. He has been MP for Havant for 22 years.
