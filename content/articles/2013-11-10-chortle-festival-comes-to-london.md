The British comedy website Chortle has announced its first comedy book festival – which will take place in Ealing at the end of this month. The festival will open with a stand up gala in Ealing Town Hall, featuring hit comedians including Richard Herring and Shappi Khorsandi. This opening event will be hosted by Logan Murray, known for his appearances in TV shows such as _Peep Show_,_ Packet of Three_ and _Pebble Mill_.
 Other events include Robert Finn’s talk on how to turn debut novels into bestsellers and Rob Newman’s discussion on the trade secrets of Elizibethan England. Imperial alumnus Dr Simon Singh will present a lecture about the mathematical secrets of Matt Groening’s hit TV shows _The Simpsons _and _Futurama_. Jack Whitehall, star of hit shows _Fresh Meat _and _Bad Education_, will also join his father to discuss their recently released book Him & Me – which explores their unusual family relationship.
 Tickets range in price from £5 to £20 per event and places are limited so interested people are interested to book early.
