Imperial College London have placed 41 in the [Times Higher Education Student Experience Survey](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/the-student-experience-survey-2013/2003450.article). This is up from a position of 71 last year. University of East Anglia came top of the table, with Oxford in second and Sheffield in third.

The area that Imperial seemed to stand out most in was the “Fair Workload” category. Imperial came bottom of the table for this category.

The table, which is now in its eighth year, was produced using responses from students who were polled between September 2011 and September 2012. The table takes into account 21 aspects of university life. These parameters range from the academic side of life to the social.
