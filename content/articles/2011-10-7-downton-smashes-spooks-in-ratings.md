The second series of ITV’s latest (and very successful) foray into the world costume drama began towards the end of the summer break, with its first episode clocking up over ten million viewers. But why? This unusually high figure is rarely reached by similar programming on the BBC, and ITV aren’t usually known for their ability to produce a good period piece, or, for that matter, anything other than the X Factor-esque arse-gravy which routinely hypnotises fourteen-year-old girls and their chavvy mothers. Moreover, the BBC pitched their flagship drama Spooks against Downton in the prime-time 9pm Sunday slot, but the first episode drew in a mere 4.6 million - one of the lowest ratings ever recorded for Spooks.

Jim Carter, who plays Mr Carson the Butler (image: left) says “people [didn’t] think costume dramas [were] for them - they might be ‘a bit BBC’ - highbrow and offputting. This was on ITV so they thought they’d give it a go”.

If you’ve never tried costume drama, now is the time!
