[Jeremy Grantham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Grantham), who, through the [Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment](http://www.granthamfoundation.org/), funds the[ Grantham Reasearch Institute on Climate Change ](http://www2.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/Home.aspx)(of which there is [one in Imperial](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/climatechange)) has written for [Nature](http://www.nature.com/news/be-persuasive-be-brave-be-arrested-if-necessary-1.11796) saying that scientists should “Be persuasive. Be brave. Be arrested (if necessary)”. He wanted scientists to speak out forcefully over issues that concern global warming. He argued that there was a resource crisis coming and that more scientists need to speak out about climate change. In the opinion piece for Nature he said: “It is crucial that scientists sound a more realistic, more desperate, note on global warning”. In the article he also discusses economic issues such as food prices. He ended with: “This is not only the crisis of your lives – it is also the crisis of our species’ existence. I implore you to be brave.”
