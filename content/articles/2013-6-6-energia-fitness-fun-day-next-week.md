Free fitness classes will be held on the Energia Fitness Fun Day, which is on Wednesday 19 June, in Ethos. The Active Lifestyle Team is bringing the day to students and you do not need to be a member of Ethos to take part.

There will be special guests, such as “a mystery, world renowned Les Mills studio instructor” teaching a Body Pump class. Other special classes include Tai Chi on Prince’s Gardens and salsa dancing.
 To book a place in one of the studio classes, call Ethos on 020 7594 6660. For outdoor classes, you just need to turn up five minutes before the class starts. Pre-booking is recommended, as spaces are limited, especially for the indoor studio classes. More information can be obtained by emailing the team running the event on [actlife@imperial.ac.uk](mailto:actlife@imperial.ac.uk).
