December 24th: World War Two Codebreaker Alan Turing finally receives Posthomous royal pardon 61 years after being convicted for “homosexuality”.

Alan Turing, a mathematician known for helping GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters) break the Nazi Enigma machine encryption during World War II, was charged with “homosexuality” at the age of 39. Turing, colloquilally named “the Father of Modern Computing” was a Cambridge-educated mathematician who played a very significant part in the war effort at Bletchley Park, the centre of WWII wartime codebreakng.

Turing was charged with “Homosexuality” when admitting to having a relationship with another man while reporting a theft at his house. The court case Regina v. Turing and Murray that took place on 31st March, 1952 led to Turing being sentenced, after which he chose to receive chemical treament to reduce his libido rather than face imprisonment. Two years later Turing was found dead from cyanide poisoning in his appartment, with the general consensus being that he committed suicide.

Turing’s pardon was requested by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling MP, who later stated, “Dr Turing deserves to be remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort and his legacy to science. A pardon from the Queen is a fitting tribute to an exceptional man.” The Queen, who had been on the throne for less than two months when Turing has sentenced, granted a to Turing pardon under the Royal Prerogative of Mercy on Christmas Eve, 2013.
