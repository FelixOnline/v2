A petition demanding that the Union “replace Bug Light with an actual beer” has attracted 276 signatures at the time of going to press. Started last Friday, the petition claims rising prices are “ruining the experiences of virtually all Imperial students”.

The Union said that the move from Stella Artois to Bud Light would save students more than £10,000 as remaining with Stella would have required a 10p price increase to £2.80. The move is also supposed to ensure drink prices do not exceed inflation (currently at 2.9%).  The petition attacks this as “complete bollocks”, saying that the price has risen 12.5% in terms of alcohol content. In order to maintain a real-terms price freeze, the petition argues that Bud Light should be priced at £2.36 per pint.

It goes on to assert that the Union could sell cheaper and better beer while still making a profit. A pint of Bud Light in the Union bars costs £2.70. The same in Wetherspoons is £2.30. The petition suggests that Wetherspoons be given a contract to run the Union bars as “clearly [Wetherspoons] could do a better job of not ripping off the Union’s beloved members.”

The petition has been signed by 1.5% of ICU members. Supporters have commented “no human should have to drink Bud Light”. Descriptions of the beer include “trash”, “shit”, and “fake beer”.

Deputy President (Finance & Services) Matt Blackett declined to comment.
