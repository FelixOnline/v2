Imperial finally has (or at least very shortly will have) an official Union sanctioned BMX and Skateboard Society, so we introduce to you, Imperial SB!

We meet up every Wednesday, Friday and Sunday for park and street sessions. Wednesday and Sunday sessions tend to be held at skateparks and Friday sessions reserved for street, but this depends on the weather forecast and prevailing mood gauged by the Facebook group. Just Facebook “SB Imperial” to find the group and join. It provides a forum for news, photos, videos and most importantly details of upcoming sessions! If you don’t have Facebook contact Ed Brial (eb1409@ic.ac.uk) and we’ll add you to the mailing list (when it goes live). Newcomers and experienced skaters/riders are welcome, so if you put up your board or bike when you came to Imperial, claw yourself from the morass of coursework and lab reports and enjoy some fast, simple fun.

We aim to build a non-competitive group of riders to enjoy London’s plethora of skateparks and spots. The group will also have media tentacles and travelling legs, photographing and filming whatever goes down , whilst planning some National and International trips in the future. Watch out for our pub skate-crawl at the start of next term, where we’ll aim to get everyone together and kickstart Imperial’s BMX and skateboard community.

So if you’re interested, Facebook “SB Imperial” and join, or email Ed, turn up to one of the sessions (we’ll share our boards and bikes if you don’t have one yet) and we’ll help film/photo/ride/skate with you.
