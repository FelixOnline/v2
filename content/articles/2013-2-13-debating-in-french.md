While English language debating is already well established as a student activity in British universities (such as Imperial) and indeed in many universities across the world, French language debating has, until now, been completely non-existent, even in proudly Francophone institutions.

This year, however, French language debating societies “Révolte-Toi!” have been set up in both Paris and London with the express intention of promoting French culture and public dialogue. Until now, London events have exclusively taken place far, far away, on the distant and sombre campuses of UCL and the LSE. Next Monday – the 18th of February, this sorry situation is set to change – as it finally becomes Imperial’s turn to play host to the latest of these meetings, which will be co-organised with Imperial’s French society and will take place at 6pm in Huxley LT145.

The workshop is designed to be accessible to everyone- – regardless of their level of French or previous experience of debating. It will consist of a brief introduction, followed by speaking games in French, and will finally conclude with a passionate – though hopefully friendly – debate between a few brave souls willing to stand up and speak in front of an audience! It will be a perfect opportunity to practice public speaking in French whilst discussing topics of fundamental interest to society.

Whether you are a native French speaker from the hip suburbs of Paris or someone who valiantly battled through GCSE French- there is bound to be something there to appeal to you.

« Révolte-Toi ! » vous donne rendez-vous lundi prochain, à 18h, dans la salle LT145 de Huxley Building!
