A Good Meaty Meal After Our Vegan Month: Roast Lamb Leg with Apricot and Thyme

Serves 8  
 Leg of lamb on the bone  
 6 dried apricots slices into thirds  
 Sprigs of fresh thyme  
 Olive oil  
 1tbsp apricot jam  
 Gravy:  
 4tbsp flour  
 570ml stock  
 1tbsp white wine  
 ½ tsp soy sauce  
 Pinch of dried thyme  
 2tbsp apricot jam

Preheat oven 220°C/425°C. Calculate baking time: allow 20mins per 420g, plus an extra 20mins. Stab the meat with a small knife, pushing the apricot pieces and thyme into the holes. Coat in oil, sprinkle with salt and bake. Turn the oven down to 180°C/350°C after 20mins. 30mins before the end of cooking time coat lamb in apricot jam (when cooked leave the meat to rest covered in foil for 15mins before carving). Use the juices from the roasting tray to make the gravy: Spoon off the fat from the surface, then use a scraper and a little stock to dissolve away some of the meat stuck to the tray. Add flour to the saucepan, pouring in enough juices to make a roux. Add the rest of the juices and stock, season and whisk. Add the white wine, soy sauce and thyme, bringing it to the boil and simmer for a few minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the apricot jam and taste before serving. Serve with roast potatoes and green vegetables.
