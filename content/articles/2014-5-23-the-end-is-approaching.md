So, you’re halfway through term time and you’re probably wondering what has happened, it’s almost the end of May and the end of term soon approaches.

If you’re lucky you’ve already done your exams and are having a relatively easier time doing a project, or lazing around and annoying you’re friends. If not, well... As D:Ream used to say: things can only get better.

Of course, there are still lots of things going on for the rest of term, and also over summer, for those of you who are around. In terms of Felix, we’re hoping to bring you the results of the Sex Survey next week, we’ve managed to drag enough people away from exams and revision in order to make it happen! Keep your eyes peeled!

We’re also focusing on a bit of democracy for once. We’ll be working with select people from the Union to bring a Higher Education Fees debate to campus, before Union Council members represent your views at the Union Council meeting in June. Do you have any strong views on the Education system, and is students are currently denied access to education? If so, send us an email at __felix@imperial.ac.uk__ and keep your eyes peeled.

Meanwhile if you know anybody who has actually done useful for a club or society that you are a member of, or if you’ve attended a particulary good student run event or campaign, or if you just think you know somebody who has put far more effort into doing stuff at the Union (especially in Clubs & Socs), maybe consider nominating them for a Union Award. They get a tie (I think) :)
