Bass legend Les Claypool returns with the only band to earn its own ID3 genre tag. The band is known for off-kilter prog-funk with metal roots. Trademark syncopated riffs return with newfound minimalism. This album conceptually focuses on the “desaturating seven”, a band of goblins who chase rainbows and eat their colors, as based on Ul de Rico’s _The Rainbow Goblins_. The album underdelivers; while the concept is interesting, this is clearly not Primus’s best work.  Good for completionists and Primus superfans.
