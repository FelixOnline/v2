South African football captain Senzo Meyiwa was killed by armed robbers in his girlfriend’s house. It is believed that he was trying to defend his girlfriend before the robbers demanded his mobile phone; a shot was fired in the ensuing altercation. The South African police have launched a major manhunt for his killers, who fled on foot. As a tribute to the goalkeeper, South Africa have moved their upcoming match against Sudan to Durban, which was Meyiwa’s home town.

In other news, Andy Murray confirmed his place at the World Tour Finals in London next month with a supreme victory over Grigor Dimitrov in the Paris Masters. Last week Murray won a marathon match against Tommy Robredo to win the Valencia Open, in which he had to save five match points.

Defending Champions Manchester City were sent out of the League Cup by Newcastle on Wednesday night.

On Sunday evening Manchester United scored in the 94th minute to rescue a draw against Chelsea in the Premier League, sparking wild celebrations.

Jonathan Trott has been selected for the England Lions in cricket. Trott was sidelined in December after complaining of a stress related illness, but made his comeback for Warwickshire during the summer. It’s been a tough couple of weeks for Australia captain Michael Clarke, as his team were ruthlessly dismantled by Pakistan. The second match hasn’t started well either – Pakistan ended day one on 304-2.

The NFL made a return to Wembley last weekend, with the Detroit Lions completing a remarkable comeback against the Atlanta Falcons to win 22-21.
