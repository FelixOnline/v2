__[Tabloid Special]__

__Further concerns have been raised in recent weeks about the structural integrity of the Fisher Hall buildings in Evelyn Gardens, including the event mentioned in the above title. __

Following a prior investigation of Fisher last year, this author visited again to examine the most recent developments as the building slowly disintegrates around the poor Freshers inside. The alarming incidents reported add to the recent controversy surrounding the college’s accommodation policy, with both the move to North Acton and the poor quality of the Wilson House refurbishment sources of concern.

Upon revisiting Fisher, the first Fresher we encountered (who wishes to remain anonymous) repeatedly described the building as a ‘shithole’, and mentioned that they knew someone who had been moved to another hall for a week recently as the accommodation team worked to repair part of the ceiling that had apparently collapsed. They was happy to take us to a part of the building in the corner of House 30 not previously visited, where their friend gave us a guided tour of a double room.

The ceiling behind the door had a metre-long crack running through it, which is reported to leak. The far corner near the window contained a rather unsightly black patch of mould, which the occupant insisted that the College were aware of but had yet to rectify. Something tells me that the room in question room won’t be available for tours on the upcoming accommodation open day.

Travelling upwards, we encountered a flooded bathroom with a non-functional light, and a rather worrying sight outside room 310 in House 24. ‘The cave’ is a longstanding Fisher feature, a passage between rooms and the kitchen, which has at most four feet of headroom. However, a portion of the wall that was clearly marked as containing the carcinogen asbestos appeared to have been patched up with a large amount of silver duct tape. Exactly what lies beneath this duct tape is unknown, but nonetheless one would think that asbestos regulations would require more than just duct tape to contain it.

Electrical safety in the building does appear to have improved, with the old telephone circuits being removed and the fuseboxes checked, albeit only a year too late. It is remarkable that the passing of the recommended date did not appear to trouble the hall team as much as some origami birds that were hung from the fire alarm in a students’ room last year, which resulted in a stern email highlighting the extreme danger this posed sent to said student and much chastising.

It is also clear that the College have given up any form of aesthetic maintenance when it comes to Fisher. Most of the walls are falling apart and cracking, the paint in most places is peeling and the carpets look like they haven’t been cleaned in many years.

This is really quite unfortunate, given that many residents appear to be quite attached to what is left of the building and the survivor spirit and camaraderie that it inspires.

Given the number of problems plaguing the College’s last major accommodation project, the late and shoddy Wilson refurbishment which resulted in an untreated fungal infestation that would have fascinated even the most experienced of the Biology department’s mycologists and floors that were so uneven and mislaid that wardrobes seemed in danger of toppling, one wonders if it would not be better to spend the several hundred million pounds spent on the new halls refurbishing Evelyn Gardens to a reasonable standard?

Investigation reveals that these issues are well-known to prospective applicants, with stories of the famed 2007 Fisher ceiling collapse circulating on The Student Room. So perhaps the 2015 freshers will actually be glad of the 40-minute commute that awaits them.

A College Spokesperson said:

· Some preventative work was carried out to a corridor ceiling outside a room in January. During this work the residents of the room were unable to gain access between 10am and 5pm and were offered the use of an alternative room for this time – which they accepted. The work was carried out as planned and the students were able to gain access to their room that evening.

· Occasional water leaks from balconies or showers can cause damp. These are always reported immediately to the help desk by staff to make sure they are fixed. Accommodation staff continue to monitor the situation and students with any concerns can contact their Hall Supervisor.

· The College maintains an asbestos register across all sites and works closely with asbestos specialists to closely monitor and address any repair needs as and when they arise. There are occasions, as with the wall in question, when temporary repairs are carried out to secure an area ahead of permanent work being done. This temporary maintenance poses no health risks and permanent repairs due to take place over the summer.

· Aesthetic maintenance is ongoing in Fisher Hall and will continue. Plans are in place to redecorate approximately 25 rooms this summer.
