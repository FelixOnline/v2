The Windows boot sounds are unknown gems of the music world. Brian Eno was a collaborator!

**12. Windows 98 Plus!** 

Legitimately awful. I can’t believe the marketing theme thought this was a good idea. If I heard this noise out of my computer, I’d try to put it out with a fire extinguisher.

**11. Windows XP Home Edition.** 

God, they really couldn’t be bothered with this one, could they? Just slap four random keys and call it a day. No grandeur. No triumph.

**10. Windows 8.** 

The slight syncopation and more percussive feel adds a bit of spice and freshness to the world of boot sounds, and yet the piece is as joyless and corporate as the company making it.

**9. Windows Vista.** 

Nearly worse than the last one, except that the up ending reflects the feeling of success one feels when Vista finally fucking decided to boot for once. I’m _still_ mad that this was generously given the label of “operating system.”

**8. Codename: Whistler.** 

The clashy, jangly vibe this pulls is downright repulsive. I wouldn’t wish use of a computer running Whistler on my worst enemy in the unlikely yet still terrifying scenario that, while in mortal combat, we end up falling into a time machine and get dropped 20 years in the past.

**7. Windows Vista Beta.** 

Techno-future garbage. But at least the harmony is a little more ambitious. Sounds like something a shitty club in Berlin would play.

**6. Windows NT Workstation 4.0.** 

Still trash, but this is much less objectionable; after all, this _is_ a legitimate product of the mid-90s. And there’s something mighty appealing about the swirling synths, the mellowed near-pure sine, and the innocence with which this was clearly composed.

**5. Windows 98.** 

The vocals are simply _angelic_.

**4. Windows NT Workstation 5.0.** 

Talk about cacophony. When those synths actually kick, it’s a pretty slick feeling. Damn, was 5.0 ahead of its time.

**3. Trident.** 

No, not the bomb. Convention-breaking and legitimately futuristic. Fantastic.

**2. Windows 95.** 

What a tremendous blend of future and past. The synths sweep in, soft, delicate – filtered glockenspeil greet the airy composition. Tension is introduced to the piece when the last glockenspeil strike is repeated in triplicate – perhaps startling the unwary user, causing them to believe their computer has hung yet again. The slight fade reassures the more alert and/or caffeinated. And just when you thought it couldn’t get any better, we are greeted with a pleasantly familiar entity, the warm embrace of an old friend. I speak of the next entry in this very ranking...

**1. Windows 3.1.** 

If it ain’t broke, don’t fucking fix it.
