     I did my undergrad at Imperial, and now doing my PhD in Cambridge. I cannot think of a place more disconnected from reality and the needs of students than Imperial. It's just outrageous everything they've done so far. Threatening to close Evelyn Gardens, Garden and Weeks Halls, now the sports grounds, the Grad Student facilities are close to non-existent, sense of community is rubbish, the Life Sciences Restructure of 2011 was a joke, the Department of Humanities has been ourageously cut.... <br> <br>Well done Imperial,Local newspapers in the Teddington area have reported for quite some time that the land is potentially to be used for a new secondary school, Turing House, despite local opposition. Worth googling it. Sadly I suspect that the fact that they're announcing suspension of sport at the grounds might mean it's a done deal but who knows, perhaps student power may be able to exert some influence

In a [news statement](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/sports/newssummary/news_9-7-2014-15-20-47) released today, Sport Imperial announced once and for all that, despite outcry from medics, the Teddington sports ground will no longer be used.

This follows the news that College is planning to purchase a new sports ground in Heston, spanning 27 acres and provides indoor and outdoor facilities. The site is located two miles from Imperial’s other sporting site, the Harlington ground, and from next September, the use of Teddington Sports Ground will be suspended “until the new arrangement is properly assessed.”

The statement goes on to say that “Whilst no formal decision has been made there are no plans for student sport to take place at Teddington in the future.”

The rumours surrounding the suspension of the use of this land has caused controversy online, with the hashtag #SaveTeddington populated with various medical sports teams voicing their concern over the decision. A[ petition](http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/save-teddington-sports-ground) has also been circulated to keep sports at Teddington that at time of press has over 400 signatures.

One student, Alistair Brown, currently a fifth year medical student, has written on the petition page that “This apparently underhand move to dismantle the medical school exacerbates an us-and-them culture which is not healthy moving forward.”

Teddington, the grounds used primarily by ICSM sports teams, was bought in 1935 and given to St Mary’s medical school, which later merged with other surrounding schools to make up today’s ICSM.

Students have expressed concerns that Heston, the proposed new site, is too far from Imperial campuses and hospital placements. Not only that, but many are saddened by the loss of a site steeped in tradition and history.

ICSMSU President, Dariush Hassanzadeh-Baboli, said in an email sent to the medical school earlier this week: “The first time ICSMSU heard about the news was the same time as the rest of the students at Imperial College. Both the Faculty of Medicine and ICSMSU are unhappy and disappointed at the lack of warning, let alone consultation, with regards to moving ICSM Sports from their home ground of over 80 years.

Such big decisions, that disrupt the history and traditions of our medical school, should not be made without the students being consulted.”

The Imperial College statement concludes that “We know that many sports teams, particularly those of ICSM have a long history of using Teddington. The new configuration and the greater range of facilities offered at Heston, aims to enhance sports opportunities for all College clubs, including the Medics.

“Sport Imperial will be working with them to ensure that the new site meets their needs.”
