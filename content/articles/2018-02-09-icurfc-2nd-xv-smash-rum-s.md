Last Wednesday saw the mighty 2nd XV take on pesky medics from UCL (RUMS) at Fortress Harlington – the same team that they’d comfortably beaten 36-7 away just a couple of weeks previously. With the classic bitter cold wind swirling in the Fortress, the anticipation of that night’s ACC on everyone’s minds and coach LJ with his standard “win this and go out and get smashed later” team talk, the scene was set. The match started perfectly for IC with some strong carries across the gain line sucking in the RUMS defence and leaving space out wide for Ifan Dafydd to go over in the corner for the first try of the match. Not long after, Harold Pinter crossed the whitewash after hitting a beautiful line through the midfield and with the pace of a back, second row Gianluigi Tosti also bagged a meat pie. By half time, Imperial were leading 19-0 and just one more try would secure them the bonus point.

Early on in the second half, after some pressure in the RUMS 22, it looked like Imperial were about to get this bonus point when Jack Fraser threw a beautifully weighted flat pass straight into the arms of a RUMS player who ran in a 90m interception try – always nice to give the opposition some hope I suppose.  This slight hiccup was no worry for the IC men though and the bonus point try was secured shortly afterwards. Tries came in thick and fast in the second half and at times it felt as if the RUMS defence was like Ifan’s hair – non-existent.  Harold Pinter teased the RUMS defence further as he ran through the middle of three players, ball in one hand, and placed the ball right underneath the sticks. The second half also saw some big replacements come on and make an instant impact. Andreas Jesperson, who recently claimed he could play any position, showed that he could at least play on the wing by scoring a 50m try with his first touch of the ball. Later on that evening, he would tell this tale to a female in the Union bar and she would fall in love with him. A small drop in concentration in the final minute of the game meant that RUMS got their second and final try in the match but that did not hamper the spirits of the IC boys too much who could already taste the victorious post-match port and pints.

Eight tries were scored in total by the IC men that day, Ifan Dafydd, Harry Bradley (sorry, Brady) and Gianluigi Tosti completed a hat-trick of hat-trick avoidances whilst Wilbur Sandoe and Andreas Jesperson got a meat pie each too. (Paddy) Jackson Fraser certainly brought his kicking boots with him too, successfully landing 6 of the 8 conversions in less than ideal kicking conditions. Coach LJ awarded two man of the match performances that day, one to Rob Lawrence who proved that turning up to trainings is actually pointless and the other to Ifan Dafydd who proved that you’re never too old to play. The final score, Imperial 52 – 12 RUMS, meant the team were now 9 points clear on top of the league and still undefeated. Sylvia was sung yet again.
