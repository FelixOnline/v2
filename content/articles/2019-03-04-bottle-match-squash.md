With no feature in last year’s bottle, squash returned with noise, and lots of it. Ethos witnessed an atmosphere rivalling sporting cathedral, with quality squash played in a great competitive spirit. 

RSM took an early lead thanks to 4th string George Meddings who won 3/0, but were levelled when 2nd string Jamie Stringer was outlasted 3/1 by the opposition captain. Jamie was 1 game and 9-9 into the 2nd, slightly unlucky not being able to sneak through! 

Our 5th string Oliver Taylor-Rose was out powered 3/0 by his opposite number but played some great squash himself at time. At 2/1 down in the tie, 3rd string Eric Newland needed to win to keep RSM hopes alive but was defeated in three tight games by an experienced opponent. 

With the match gone, some pride was restored as our team captain and 1st string blitzed his opposite number 3/0, leaving the final match score at 3-2 to CSM. With a packed gallery and a great atmosphere, the Friday squash fuelled enthusiasm for the rest of the weekend sport, here’s to hoping it stays for next year!
