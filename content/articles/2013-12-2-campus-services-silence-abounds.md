One week further into the confusion over cleaning in halls and Campus Services has yet to reply to the questions sent to them by Felix over two weeks ago, begging the question: Does the department feel any obligation to providing its stakeholders with satisfactory information? We now approach the end of the first term of the academic year, and for some students there is still confusion over their cleaning rotas, and some would still like to see some token of apology from the department in regards to the poor communication that has gotten so out of hand.

One major cause for concern is the fact that despite the duration that the changes have been in effect, some students still have no idea about whether they have access to cleaning equipment, and if they do have access, some still may not be aware to find it. Here at Felix we find it upsetting that many new students will have waited a full four weeks before their rooms have been cleaned, without the option to clean it themselves.

Felix believes that at a minimum the Campus Services department should provide much more information about the feedback process they consulted before making the changes, as well as the decisions and reasoning that led to the final choice.

Hopefully, at the upcoming cleaning services review (that Campus Services promised in their most recent missive) we will see a situation where the people who are affected most by the changes get to have some input into the cleaning solution, whether they would like things to return to the way they are, or whether they have suggestions that would drastically improve both their happiness and wellbeing.
 Looking forward to the future, Felix hopes that all College departments will learn from this mistake and will consult or at least inform stakeholders of important changes to the services it provides, rather than just implementing changes, which are announced at a later date.
