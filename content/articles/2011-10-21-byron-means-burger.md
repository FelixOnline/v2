“I want to keep fighting because it is the only thing that keeps me out of the hamburger joints. If I don’t fight, I’ll eat this planet.” Take this George Foreman quote, replace ‘fight’ with ‘study’ and ‘hamburger joints’ with ‘Byron’ and it’s instantly applicable to me. Well, sort of. OK, not really, but I still really like Byron.

For the unenlightened, Byron is a hamburger restaurant chain that was set up in 2007, with seventeen restaurants currently scattered about central and greater London, two of which are almost on Imperial’s doorstep (one opposite Gloucester Road station, the other a few minutes walk from South Kensington station).

They all sport a clean, minimalistic look, but at the same time none of their restaurants have never felt cold, simply because they’re always bustling with life. Or maybe I’ve always been far too focused on the delicious food to ever take notice.

Byron’s menu isn’t exhaustive by any means, but by GOD do they focus their attention well. If you’ve never been a fan of hamburgers simply because no place seems to get them right, try here. No soggy salad, no overload of cheese, buns that actually complement the meal rather than exist as a source of carbohydrates...

Am I getting the message across that I really rather like this place? The classic cheese is the crowning jewel; six ounces of freshly ground beef (cooked, obviously) with a slice of cheddar (or the cheese of your choice) and just the right amount of veggies to keep me sufficiently hooked and drooling all over my keyboard.

Outside of the Heaven-sent hamburgers are a modest number of main and side salads, which, whilst crunchy and better than most, pale in comparison to their meatier main course brethren. The choice for vegetarians is somewhat limited however – there’s a veggie burger (made with grilled Portobello mushroom), and one of the salads is meat-free (the buffalo mozzarella and lentil), but beyond that you’re rather limited in choice.

If you like either of those then you’re in for a treat, but slightly pickier vegetarians may very well want to give Byron a miss. Obligate carnivores on the other hand will not be disappointed.
 The dessert menu is small as well, but does contain some very nice after-dinner treats to indulge yourself with. Unfortunately light sorbets or fruit salads are missing from the menu; often after a large meal the last thing you want to eat is a rich chocolate brownie or cream-laden banana split.
 Something small and sweet to end the meal with would round it off nicely, possibly accompanied by a glass of wine – of which there is a respectable selection.

I could try and go on about meat texture, subtle flavours and whatnot, but at the end of the day I’m no food buff. Let me put it simply – I know what I like, and I like Byron. So will you.
