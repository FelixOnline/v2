## 1
Sit as far back as you possibly can (Obvious really)
## 2
Get a laptop and headphones and you’re basically sorted
## 3
Get a handheld console (mobile games don’t count)
## 4
Ok, maybe some of them do count
## 5
Play a game where it looks like you’re taking notes
## 6
Avoid games where you’ll be constantly clicking and swearing (*cough* League of Legends *cough*
## 7
Convince your lecturer Mortal Kombat will help you understand thermodynamics. Bonus points if they let you set up in the lecture hall
## 8
Get a bunch of people together to make a LAN party at the back of the lecture theatre. All for one and one for all
## 9
Or maybe just don’t go to lectures in the first place
