  Garside’s window-smashing soundtrack
subtitle: >
  Punk music, and its offshoots, has always retained a continuing theme of protest against society’s wrongs. Here are some of my favourites.

## G.L.O.S.S – G.L.O.S.S (We’re from the Future)
Hardcore punk music has always been chronically male dominated and well known for its macho culture. G.L.O.S.S (Girls Living Outside Society’s Shit) used their sole release to rail against the sexism and homophobia people face in this scene, discussing issues such as gender identity and sexism.
## Left For Dead – Skin Graft
Punk has a long standing tradition of bands taking a stance on animal rights, Left For Dead’s Skin Graft being a prime example. This song is 45 seconds of violent attack on animal testing and wearing of fur, suggesting those whom endorse such acts deserve even worse treatment than the critters involved. The searing guitar and pummelling beats complete this intense experience.
## Fugazi – The Argument
The title track from Fugazi’s final album is a strong departure from their raucous earlier work. It instead presents a resigned statement on the Iraq war. Rather than fiery rhetoric, The Argument presents a mature view. This track is a beaten protest about how the same arguments always come up and always win. The stripped back nature of this song makes it a wonderful piece of art.
## Dead Kennedys – Holiday in Cambodia

The Clash and Dead Kennedys present a similar, highly political outlook, however they couldn’t be further apart. Eschewing the intelligent, prudish style of The Clash and replacing it with a crass, sarcastic voice, this track sardonically imagines how those who would go on holiday in Cambodia would appreciate being dropped into one of Pol Pot’s gulags.
## Doom – Police Bastard

The title of this song speaks for itself. Authority is held in such disdain in punk circles that it is of no surprise that this contempt extends to its enforcers. The whole of the Police Bastard EP sounds like it was recorded in a metal bin – with tinny d-beat drums competing with thin, dirty guitars – adding to the vitriol and rage in the EP’s title track.
## The Clash – The Guns Of Brixton
Their contribution to modern music as a whole needing little introduction, The Clash’s use of reggae influences and keen political lyrics have shaped and inspired many. For me, this is the best example of their signature style, reporting the defiance of communities in the face of racism and police brutality.
## Earth Crisis – Firestorm
It would be hard to justify not including this track. Firestorm describes a drug epidemic hitting the narrator’s city. Earth Crisis issues a call for punks to militarise with straight-edgers, taking the fight to those who use drugs. The views in this song are ignorant and inflexible, much like many 90’s hardcore songs. This makes Firestorm a great look into a highly political, aggressive scene teetering on the edge of self parody.
## Refused – Rather Be Dead

{{< figure src="http://felixonline.co.uk/img/upload/201611251405-felix-Refused-rather-be-dead.jpg" title="" caption="" attr="Startracks Records" >}}

Refused have always been a political band with strong anarchist leanings. At least, they were until they played Coachella for money reasons. Rather Be Dead itself is an angry tirade against all forms of authority and a firm pledge that Refused are prepared to fight the power. This all takes place over tense chugging, palm muted guitars
