The National Union of Students (NUS) has rejected a motion condemning Islamic State after a stirring speech by Black Students Officer Malia Bouattia, in which she asserted that passing the motion would be akin to “a justification for war and blatant Islamaphobia (sic)”. The motion said that the NUS would “support unity between Muslims, condemn the bloody terror of ISIS, and support a boycott on people who fund the militants”.

In response, leading proposer of the motion Daniel Cooper said that he has “looked again and again at the contents of the motion, yet I cannot track any Islamophobia or racism”. Bouattia was quick to add that the NUS Black Students’ Campaign “stand[s] in complete solidarity with the Kurdish people against the recent attacks by ISIS and join many others in condemnation of their brutal actions”.

“The NUS Black Students’ Campaign will be working with Kurdish students and the International Students Campaign to raise this issue within the NUS. A motion will be taken to the next NUS National Executive, which truly reflects the situation. This motion will pose a condemnation of the politics and methods of ISIS as well as unequivocal support for the Kurdish people.”
