Science fiction often paints a scary picture of the future where science and technology have run amok with devastating consequences. Titles such as Brave New World, The Day After Tomorrow and Frankenstein conjure up fearful images in our minds. Many scientists feel that such works have hindered progress by creating a public that is scared of new and potentially beneficial technologies such as GM and cloning. I think they’re wrong.

Firstly, I do not believe that the vast majority of “the public” (whoever the hell that means) are as gullible as they’re made out to be. To my knowledge people did not develop a sudden fear of monkeys after watching Planet of the Apes. In fact people often have positive reactions to emerging technologies even after viewing “scary” sci-fi. A study found that after reading the novel Prey, where a swarm of nanoparticles runs riot, people had a more positive view of nanotechnology compared to those who had not read the novel. Rather than causing concern, I think that science fiction reflects a fear of technology that many people innately hold.

Secondly, to assume that science fiction “harms” science forgets about its many benefits; who as a kid was not inspired to get into science because of the space ships on Star Trek or the massive dinosaurs on Jurassic Park? I would hasten a guess that many of you would not be in science today if it weren’t for such films. Even professional scientists are inspired to push the boundaries of their subjects by sci-fi. The creator of the mobile phone, Martin Cooper, credits Captain Kirk’s smart gadget as the inspiration behind the whole idea of a portable phone.

Positive portrayals of science in sci-fi are not in short supply. In fact, in a vast number of films such as Outbreak, Deep Impact and Independence Day, science is portrayed as the world’s saviour. To say that sci-fi in some way hinders progress is certainly not true – its benefits surely outweigh its disadvantages. Besides… it doesn’t really matter: science fiction is a part of life and nothing’s going to change that. At the end of the day it’s just a bit of fun – so don’t get yourselves worried, as I’m sure you were…
