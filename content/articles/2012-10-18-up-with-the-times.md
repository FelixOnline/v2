__Overall Rankings__

_The Times_

Imperial College London has come in 4th in the league table. This is the same place as last year but a rank below from in 2011, where we came 3rd.
 Imperial have come above London rival University College London (UCL), which came in 7th place.

_The Sunday Times_

Imperial came in 8th place which is a significant improvement from last year’s position of 14th place. We rank beneath universities such as Bath, Durham and Exeter.

__Subject tables__

_The Times_

Most subjects such as Geology, Medicine, Computer Science, Materials and Biology have hovered around the same ranking since 2011.

Other subjects have stayed consistent in their ranking, like Civil Engineering and Chemical Engineering in 2nd place, and Electronical and Electrical Engineering in 4th place.
 However some subjects, like Mathematics for instance, have suffered a dramatic fall from 3rd to 7th place. Chemistry had a slight improvement from 18th up to 16th place.

__Teaching__

_The Times_

Imperial’s student-staff ratio scored 11.6 which is calculated on the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) for 2010 -11. The Student Satisfaction which includes academic support, scored 78 and is based on the NationalStudent Survery.

Our Good Honours scored 81.7% where this is the percentage of graduates getting a first or upper second class degree. But this could be due good teaching, lenient marking towards giving people better grades, or our courses being easier.

_The Sunday Times_

The Sunday Times gave Imperial 146 out of 250 (58.4%) for Teaching Excellence based on student satisfaction combined with teaching quality, academic support, assessment and feedback.

The number of students getting Firsts/2:1s is 83 out of 100 for Imperial Sudents.

__Academics__

_The Times_

Research Quality for Imperial scored 0.99 where the grades come from the 2008 Research Assessment Excerise and is adapted to reflect the process used to distribute research funding in England.

According the Times table, 87.1% of Imperial graduates are employed within 6 months of graduating based on HESA for 2010 graduates

_The Sunday Times_

Imperial scored 147 out of 200 (73.5%) for Research Quality based on the Research Assessment Exercise in 2008.

The Sunday Times indicated that 175 per 200 graduates are employed within 6th months (which works out as 87.5% of graduates).
