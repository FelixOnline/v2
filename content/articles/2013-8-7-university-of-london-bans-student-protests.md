     You raise a fair point. If she had left with the police peacefully, she would have stood a much better chance of getting away with her freedom, or a slight tap on the wrist. <br>The video was interesting to watch, as was the attitude of the students to the police. <br>I'm keeping an eye out for the results of the case... ,Have you seen the video of her being arrested: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kahUH7JaFRE <br>She bloody deserves to be arrested for the way she and the other idiots around there acted, kicking and screaming on the floor like a child is not the way to get your point across, unless your point is that you're an immature idiot with jumped up ideas and no concept of the consequences of your actions.

After recent escalating tension between the University of London and the soon-to-be-extinct University of London Union a new act of aggression has been revealed. The University of London has sent a letter to the ULU banning protests by students on parts of the University’s property.

[In the letter, written by the University’s Chief Operating Officer Chris Cobb](http://bit.ly/12ZDE6q), the University uses safety concerns for building users and the perceived disruption of people using the Senate House library as an excuse for booting the student protesters off University property. Additionally the letter suggests several public spaces that can be used by the protesters instead. The University has specified that it will no longer “tolerate” demonstrations that take place outside Senate House, the cloister entrance and the East and West car-parks and will consider future protesters in these spaces to be trespassing on University property and will prosecute accordingly.

The letter follows the fallout from a recent student protest about equality in staff pay, during which the University called police to [arrest a student protester for scribbling with chalk](http://huff.to/16tKoGx) on the University’s Foundation Stone. The 24-year-old student has since pleaded not guilty to two counts of assaulting a police officer and one count of criminal damage and faces trial on 17 October, with a potential imprisonment of 12 months.
