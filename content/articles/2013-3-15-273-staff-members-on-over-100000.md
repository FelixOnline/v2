273 members of staff at Imperial College London during the period of 2011/12 were paid over £100,000. This is according to the official reports released at the end of each academic year. Keith O’Nions, the President & Rector, was, in total, renumerated £354,000. This figure is actually a reduction of last year, which was £367,000. The figure is mostly salary, but £20,000 was categorised as “Other”. The total renumeration puts O’Nions as the 4th best paid Vice-Chancellor in the UK, with only Oxford, Birmingham and UCL’s Vice-Chancellors being paid more. This does not appear to include the added benefit of the accommodation.

The total amount of money earned by the top 273 was just over £38 million. This is up £627000 from last year’s total. There are also 6 more people added from last year.
