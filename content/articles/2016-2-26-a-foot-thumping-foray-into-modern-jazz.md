**GoGo Penguin** are a Mercury Prize nominated jazz trio who are lumped into the increasingly broad genre of modern jazz; a genre best separated from its predecessors by an unashamed acceptance of rhythm. _Man Made Object_ is a testament to this. The album’s blend of classical jazz and modern house music provides a highly accessible acoustic soundscape.

The stand\-out adjective of the album is melodic. The trio have turned their backs to the extended solos and virtuoso flourishes which often repel people from traditional jazz releases. The album instead barrels along with funky instrumentation and stringently controlled improvisation to provide music which is more at home in a club than a jazz bar. Songs like ‘Smarra’ and ‘Quiet Mind’ have a dance music aesthetic similar to that adopted by **Bonobo** and other jazz\-inspired producers. The group’s use of acoustic instrumentation allows them to create this music with a strictly organic feel.

The most impressive aspect of _Man Made Object_ is its ability to maintain strong melodies with free percussion. This is best seen on the opening track ‘All Res’, where a homely piano loop allows for some upbeat drum experimentation.

The album’s subtle blending of genres allows it to break free from its inspirations. Its instrumentation lends its style most to the now defunct **Portico Quartet**, whose album _Knee Deep_ _in the North Sea_ goes painfully unrecognised as a pioneer in modern jazz music. By fusing elements of Portico Quartet’s music with the melodies of jazz\-house producers, GoGo Penguin have provided a fresh sound which is more mature than their earlier releases.

_Man Made Object_ is not the most experimental jazz album of recent times, and this shows in its numbingly predictable final tracks. Having said that, the album’s lack of pretentiousness provides a naïve beauty rarely found in jazz. The trio’s meticulous instrumentation has provided an incredibly pleasing album which acts as a fantastic gateway into the world of modern jazz.
