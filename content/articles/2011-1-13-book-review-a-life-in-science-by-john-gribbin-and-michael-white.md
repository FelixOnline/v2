John Gribbin made his name with ‘In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat’, an essential read for any aspiring Physics student. Before this, however, he collaborated with Michael White to produce this early biography of Stephen Hawking. The book covers his formative years and the reputation he built as a cosmologist.

Whilst focusing mainly on Hawking’s career as a physicist, the authors also manage to convincingly portray his family life as well as the media frenzy that surrounded (and in fact still does surround) the fact that he suffers from Motor-neurone syndrome.

It is often felt that the authors detached themselves from the emotional aspect of Hawking’s illness. However, this actually serves to make the book a more convincing science biography. Hawking himself always seeks to downplay his illness so it is fitting that the authors do not make it the main focus of the book. Hawking is a remarkable character with a sense of humour to match. This biography portrays the man and his science superbly.
