On Wednesday, the Women’s 2nd Fencing Team faced King’s for the 8th BUCS league match of the season. The team needed a win to defend their current ranking of 3rd place in the league, and to boost team morale as the two previous matches had both been losses.The situation initially looked dire, as one fencer was clearly ill, and two people were injured from the week before.

The foil team, composed of Jenifer Mizen (Jenny), Sarah Chakera, and anchored by Stephanie Martinez (Steph), dominated the piste, taking the lead in the first match and holding onto it to win 45-35. After foil, the team fenced sabre, during which Helen Pennington, Slavina Georgieva and Jing Quek won by an even greater margin, with a final score of 45-13. This meant that the epee team, composed of Helen, Slavi and Rebecca Razey (Becky), needed only four points for a draw and therefore a technical victory, or five points to win completely. Helen, Slavi and Becky fought valiantly, trying to keep the opposing team with a total score of less than 60 points. The epeeists almost, but not quite, met this target. they won 45-14, producing a final score of 135-62 to Imperial.
