Imperial’s fencing teams produced a solid set of results last week in the BUCS knockout championships to ensure their progress to the quarter-finals. Only the Men’s Seconds suffered an unfortunate loss at the hands of Aberystwyth, having made the somewhat epic journey all the way to the West coast of Wales. The Men’s Firsts and Women’s Seconds were both hosting matches at Ethos, against Keele Firsts and Oxford seconds respectively.

The Women’s Firsts were away to UCL – not a huge distance to travel. In the event they won the match, 133-96, and now face Bristol in the quarters of the Championship.

In Prince’s Gardens, the men made short work of Keele, coming out 135-81 victors and booking a place versus Durham in the next stage of the competition.

The Women’s Seconds had the easiest win of all, though, as their opponents failed to send a team. Bring on the rest!
