__To Do: [London Fashion Weekend](http://www.londonfashionweekend.co.uk/)__

_23–26 February, Tickets start at £12.50_

Once again Somerset House has opened its doors to the great British public, inviting in all those among us that yearn for the fashion week experience. The hoards of models, photographers and editors that have swarmed London this past week with street style inspirations to last us all season may already be sprinkling their magic on Paris; but for us casual Londoners, London Fashion Weekend is where it all begins.

Taking place in the official LFW show space, LFWeekend offers you the chance to perch on the benches where fashion’s elite were sat just hours before, scribbling away in their Smythson diaries and frantically tapping away at their Stella McCartney cased iPads. After days of sitting at your laptop gasping at next winter’s designs, you too can have your turn at being inspired and enlightened from the front row – and by the more relevantly coveted spring summer trends at that.

The pristine tunnels of Somerset House will be lined with rails of traditional British labels from Jaeger London to Pringle of Scotland, as well as the country’s most aspiring emerging designers so you can be first to lay your hands on Holly Fulton’s graphic art-deco prints and a piece of Maria Francesca Pepe’s conceptual ‘jewellery-wear’. Oh and did we mention that everything would be going at a cheeky discounted price?

Once you’re done shopping (albeit restocking your entire wardrobe with this summer’s pretty pastels), the pampering can begin. With industry experts such as Toni & Guy and Elizabeth Arden on hand to help revamp your look for the upcoming season, you can rest in the safe knowledge that your split ends and under-eye-bags will not be following you out of this event. Such joyous thoughts makes for the perfect time to head over to the pop-up bars and boutiques to indulge in some of fashion’s favourite munchies; from Frea Frozen Yogurt to Chambord, whilst enjoying the tracks being spun by fashion’s favourite DJs.

Whether it’s a complete wardrobe overhaul you want or just a chance to feel like a front-row editor, LFWeekend is most definitely one not to miss.

__To Visit: International Fashion Showcase__

_1–29 February, Free_

With 19 global embassies and national cultural institutes opening its doors to press, buyers and the public alike, the International Fashion Showcase promises to give an insight onto the global fashion scene like never before.

The first event of its kind in the first ever collaboration between the British Council and British Fashion Council, this exhibition was created to “honour its values of international respect, excellence, equality and friendship”, whilst celebrating the Olympic year that will bring to our capital the widest range of cultures and ethnicities yet to land on our humbled soils. From Australia to China, Italy, Korea, Japan, the US, Nigeria and Romania, to name just a few, each country is exhibiting the talented emerging designers they feel best encapsulate their country’s future of fashion on our doorsteps.
> The International Fashion Showcase has it all
Dotted around various parts of central London, the handy downloadable ‘passport’ maps out a trail to follow for fashionistas and cultural-lovers alike, with the added childish element of stamp collecting at each venue and a prize of £250 to spend at next year’s LFWeekend for the savviest explorer.

So if you feel that following the various fashion weeks online like the rest of us is just a bit too mainstream, or perhaps you just feel like you should put more of an effort to become culturally educated before the Olympics kick off this summer, the International Fashion Showcase has it all – air miles unnecessary.

__To Look Out For: Marni for H&M__

_Marni for H&M: 8 March_
TODO: image from
With a double blast from Donatella Versace featuring first a selection of loudly patterned and studded pieces inspired by her own Versace SS2012 collection, followed by a more wearable selection of cute fruit-scattered crop tops and candy coloured dresses, immediately chased up by David Beckham’s underwear collection (which was perhaps just an excuse for him to show the world he still had rock hard abs), the Swedish clothing company is now about to launch Marni for H&M.A flurry of capsule collections has taken the world by storm recently with Karl Lagerfeld for Net-A-Porter giving us a sharp monochromatic style injection, and Mary Katrantzou for Topshop blowing us away with her bright signature prints and enticing lamp shade dresses. Yet topping these has been H&M’s impressive unrelenting storm of designer collaborations, which has yet to be concluded.

However, with so much going for it and such a build up to its launch, there is one slightly large downside – this is a collection that may require overnight campouts, but then again, perhaps that’s a price worth paying for such a delectably perfect patterned look.Marni for H&M promises to be a world of silky printed dreams. The latest campaign pictures show an eclectic yet simultaneously elegant collection, effortlessly working the biggest trends this season. For the girls there are spots and stripes clashing excitedly with colour blocking and floral patterns, topped off with chunky bracelets, sweet detachable collars and large petal necklaces. Similarly for the guys, there are some surprisingly wearable pieces in simple slim cuts and luxurious fabrics – what guy doesn’t secretly fancy a bit of silk or cashmere?
