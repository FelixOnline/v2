After a chequered first term for Imperial College 3rd XV and a great performance resulting in a disappointing draw against King’s Medics three weeks ago the social side of ICURFC wanted to show what they are capable of and bring home the first win this term. A promising squad featuring five new 3rd team players made their way to Wimbledon RFC this Wednesday to face the challenge against St. George’s 2nd XV were a pitch that could have been used as a skiing piste over the last weeks rather than for a game of rugby welcomed them.

Knowing the importance of the game new coach James Hayward led the team through a professional warm-up integrating the new players and preparing them for a physical game. The team seemed to be in good shape and was switched on from the start raising hopes for the game.
 Alex Leonard kicked off and Imperial chased downhill making the first big tackles that would be needed throughout the game. From the start the 3rd XV were dominating the game hardly playing in their own half, pushing for the opposing try line. However, St. George’s defence was tight and the conditions made it almost impossible to get the ball wide. At least Jean Casademont, inside-centre and Frenchman, claims that this was the reason rather than the fading trust in his nation’s skills.

25 min in the good work by the forwards pushing hard against the opposition led to what IC thought was their first try. Unfortunately the referee, being a bit too slow to follow Will Griffiths quick touch down, didn’t award it and left the team disappointed. This unrighteousness only made IC work harder and five minutes later flyhalf Alex Leonard twisted himself through St. George’s defence like a ballet dancer completing a full pirouette before putting the ball on the ground. He did not show the same elegance but his skills on the conversion, managing to put IC 0-7 ahead after slipping on the kick. With the confidence gained the ball even made it out to the wing, something rarely seen at 3rd XV performances, where Will Cathery showed good runs and chips in his rugby union debut for Imperial College. Alas, the first half ended with prop, Alexander Karvelas, coming off injured and Edoardo Cavallazi, interim captain and learned flanker stepping up to fill the gap.

Imperial came back onto the pitch highly motivated, knowing that they would have to keep up the hard work to control their opposition especially as they were playing uphill now. The first 20 minutes of the second half were even with Imperial gaining territory but losing the ball in scrums and lineouts. Especially after Hugh MacKinnon had to come off and Imperial was left with a flanker and number 8 instead of two props St. George’s could have been dangerous. Luckily the team managed to keep up the intensity and their centre did not seem too keen to actually pass the ball. His bright ginger hair made him easy to spot and the backs stopped him before he could get anywhere close to the touch line.

With 15 minutes to go Imperial were the team in much better shape. Rob Searle and Tim Harrington making good runs on their debut, forcing the opposition to give away penalty after penalty bringing the 3s close to the try line once again. Continuous offenses by St. George’s forwards resulted in a well-deserved yellow card for their flanker leaving them with one man down fur a crucial phase of the game. A phase in which Imperial probably wanted to push for a try instead of taking the penalty kick to try and go 10-0 up... Especially as they missed the kick. Although there were only ten minutes left on the clock St. George’s spirit was not broken and they managed to turn the ball over inside their five meter zone and bring it close to Imperial’s try-line within a few minutes. A few unlucky plays including scrumhalf Luke Armitage showing his skills, kicking the ball backwards (instead of taking it into contact himself as usual) eventually resulted in a scrum for St. George’s three meters away from the try-zone. With only one actual front row player left Imperial was pushed over the line and the try in the 76 minute was inevitable. Fortunately, those five points from the try were all they scored that Wednesday as the kick did not even get close to the posts. Imperial managed to keep the ball for the last few minutes of the game and celebrated a hard-fought 5-7 win.

Considering the 0-24 loss in Harlington in the first leg this is an excellent result for Imperial College 3rd XV and with two games against similar opponents left this could be the start of a winning streak. Especially the win of St. George’s against the Imperial Medics 3rd XV last week leaves ICURFC confident for varsity.
