Throughout human history the most successful defence against uncertainty caused by otherness and strangers has been territorial and functional separation. As a result of this, in Eastern Europe, a relatively prosperous region by global standards, the vast majority of gypsies live in misery and want. Prejudice against them is wide and deep, and, on several occasions since 1989, has led to vigilante-style violence and pogroms.

_Originally from Hungary, Zoltan Varga studied Documentary Photography at the University of Wales, Newport. His work is based mainly in Britain and Eastern Europe, and focuses on social and political issues. He currently works at Imperial. _
