Julia Roberts’ very first Academy Award nomination came from her breakout role in _Steel Magnolias, _and well-deservedly so. She is a part of the faultless six-piece female ensemble that leads the film in the most vibrant, touching manner. No matter what life throws at them, the six women always stick together and manage to find a way out. They can be as delicate as the magnolia but when the situation calls for it, as tough as steel, giving the film its name.

Set in the Southern State of Louisiana, M’Lynn (Sally Field) is busy with organising her daughter Shelby’s (Julia Roberts) wedding. Local beautician Truvy (Dolly Parton) hires the slightly dorky Annelle (Daryl Hannah), a recent beauty school graduate. Also mixed in this six-pack are Ouiser (Shirley MacLaine), a cranky old lady, and Clairee (Olympia Dukakis), a calm old lady. Together, they are the best of friends, and spend some incredible times together, sharing stories, gossip, sitting around Truvy’s beauty salon, getting their various treatments done. This is until Shelby has a slight healthscare. She has type 1 diabetes, and as the film progresses, it never lets us forget about it. And what is clever about _Steel Magnolia _is how it carefully balances impending tragedy with an appropriate amount of natural humour and heartfelt poignancy.

When it comes to the performances, there is not one actress who acts as a noticeable weak link. Everyone brings something memorable to their individual roles, and it’s in this finely assembled ladies the film finds its voice. Sally Field, always so brave and stoic as the mother figure, having to shoulder all sorts of burden coming from her family, is simply mesmerising. And it’s evident her much later role as Nora Walker in the television series _Brothers & Sisters _in which she completely excelled, could have been in part, inspired by and based on her performance here. She’s even married to the same on-screen husband, Tom Skeritt, in both roles.

Dolly Parton is simply lovely to listen to, a lady with a heart of gold and the purest of intentions, as she selflessly takes care of those around her. She kindly guides Annelle as her employer, she is very understanding towards her husband (Sam Shepard) who is down on his luck.

Daryl Hannah starts off as a clueless young girl out in the real world, and she is the one who goes through the most drastic change throughout the course of the movie. The film’s relentless time jumps allow for its characters to show completely new sides to themselves, a plot method that works wonders for Annelle’s share of the story. She finds love, becomes more and more confident in her own skin, finds religion, and convincingly integrates into the ladies’ group, no longer having to be cautious, awkwardly tip-toeing around everyone.

The genius pairing of Shirley MacLaine and Olympia Dukakis provides most of the laughs. MacLaine alone can do her snarky best, but with Dukakis thrown in there, the comedic effect is more than doubled. The two old ladies are constantly sniping at each other, and watch as these two amazingly gifted actresses manage to make even the most depressing scene of the film into an unforgettable comedy highlight.

Julia Roberts, in one of her first major roles, is in truly heart-breaking mode, as she tries to have it all with her condition. She holds her own mighty well against the more seasoned veterans, and it’s no wonder her career got a boost from this point on.

In a picture crowded by so many women, it’s only natural for the men to be sidelined. The husbands, boyfriends come and go, appearing merely to tell us that these women have families. But the male roles are of course highly limited compared to those of what the females are given.

It’s a film that has as many laughs as it does tears. It’s a film with witty dialogue and made with utmost sincerity. And hey, it’s one of the films that made James Franco cry. True story.
