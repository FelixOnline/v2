Black metal has undoubtedly seen regeneration in recent years. Releases such as __Deafheaven__’s_ Sunbather _or __Altar of Plagues__’ _Teethed Glory and Injury_ in 2013 were well received, provided you were looking for challenging music with power behind it. However, you’d be mistaken if it was purely “good black metal” that is suddenly hitting home with the hipsters, rather than just metalheads – really, it’s what these bands do on these albums that isn’t metal at all that grabbed people’s attention. Enter __Alcest__, who have been playing this game for years, merging the typical blast beats, high screams, tremolo guitars and proggy structures of black metal with a mystical dreamy atmosphere. And just as black metal had become cool, fans are left scratching their heads as Alcest abandon the very ship they left port on.

_Shelter_ strips out the metal from Alcest’s original sound. This isn’t at all sudden, as the screams have been dying off consistently since _Ecailles De Lune_ in 2010. On _Shelter_, clean guitars weave dream pop songs with walls of effects. The space left by the metal is now filled with a wider sound palette –pianos, guest vocals, choirs and heavily layered guitars, fitting well with frontman Neige’s ethereal voice. Many of these are present on the title track, probably the most representative song on the album, where choruses are a merge of vocal hooks, simple drumming and droning guitar.

Don’t assume that _Shelter_ never feels heavy because of this style shift. _Voix Sereines_, begins with familiar vocal and clean guitar passages, and has a fantastic gradual build to its euphoric ending, where we do hear distortion guitars with the new post-rock sound. _Délivrance_ does much the same, with even bolder choirs, strings and a final crescendo which ends with almost __Godspeed__-guitar drone.

It’s not all memorable, as some of the poppier songs are easily Alcest’s weakest efforts (such as _Away_, or _Opale_ – unfortunately the single). The key in enjoying _Shelter_ is in realising what really makes Alcest good. Behind all the noise, be it waves of reverb or bone splitting distortion, it’s the songwriting and atmosphere that has always been present making them worth listening to. It’s still the same gift on _Shelter_, it just not in the same wrapping paper as before. Disappointed it’s not black metal? Hush now, don’t worry – __Agalloch__ and __Wolves In The Throne Room__ will be saving the day this 2014.
