_“It’s the zombies I’m sick of, and their fear of their own fucking imaginations.”_

The result of over 7 years work, Jim Jarmusch’s latest film takes a bold new look at the gothic classic of vampires. Set in modern day Tangiers and Detroit, the film follows Adam (Tom Hiddleston – _Thor_) an underground musician who, separated from his wife Eve (Tilda Swinton – _We Need To Talk About Kevin_), has become disillusioned with human society and craves for the past. Fearful for Adam’s wellbeing, Eve visits him in Detroit where the recluse Adam has hidden himself to write his music, away from the ‘zombies’. Constantly searching for the few remaining sources of uncontaminated blood, Adam and Eve roam the dark streets and pass the relics of another time, reluctant to kill in order to fulfil their need. But when Eve’s zombie-like sister Ava appears(Mia Wasikowska – _Alice in Wonderland_), it becomes all too clear that even with incredible care, being a vampire in the modern world is not so easy.

An incredible feat of cinematography and soundtrack, Jarmusch has weaved dark psychedelic sounds with vivid images of blood and beauty that have resulted in this true spectacle of gothic filmmaking. Laced with references to all the classics, the film creates a universe where all the great artists in history are connected to the vampires, introducing Christopher Marlowe (John Hurt – _Alien_) as a friend of Adam and Eve’s. With his connections, Marlowe supplies some of the top quality O-negative blood, showing the evolution of the classical vampire. Comically namedropping dozens of other legendary associates of theirs, the vampires observe how the once great city of Detroit has become a shadow of its former self. With this, Jarmusch criticises the loss of creativity in the contemporary society, but shows how glimmers of hope can still be found in the quiet corners of the world. This in particular is highlighted through the significantly more optimistic voice of Eve, poignantly informing Adam that “This self-obsession is a waste of living”. While the film maintains its dark undertone throughout, the intense naturalism of the performances at times shows a refreshing new side to the archetypal vampire. Intelligent and witty, Hiddleston and Swinton’s performances are sharp and sensual, reflecting the intriguing nature of Jarmusch’s characters and really strengthening the tension held throughout the film.

While I wouldn’t go as far as to say the film is modern classic, it does have all the hallmarks of a true cult film in the making; an homage to Jarmusch’s status in the field of independent cinema. With the character strengths of _Withnail and I _and the blood induced trips reminiscent of _Trainspotting_, Jarmusch’s film has really taken the best from modern cinema and told a story unlike most that are found in the cinemas today. Adam and Eve might be the “condescending snobs” Ava describes, but the superb injection of this age old genre into the modern day could not be done without their posh peculiarities. This film really is Jim Jarmusch back to his best. Say no more.
