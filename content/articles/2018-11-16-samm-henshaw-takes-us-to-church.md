I recently had the pleasure of being in attendance as Samm Henshaw treated fans to a phenomenal one-off show.

Samm Henshaw rose to popularity following the success of his two-part _Sound Experiment EP_ projects, the most recent of which was released in 2016. Samm has since largely been on the road, touring in support of the likes of Chance the Rapper, who hand-picked him for the European leg of the _Coloring Book_ tour. 

Although it has been over two years since he last released a project, Samm has steadily been whetting fans’ appetites through the relase of singles all throughout 2018. He kicked off his set with one such single, asking the crowd, “how are we all feeling?” before launching into the anthemic ‘How Does It Feel?’. This had the crowd rocking and the energy levels remained high as he performed a plethora of unreleased tracks (look out for new track ‘Church’ when it drops) and his more recent single, ‘Broke’. Things took a soulful turn as he slowed things down with classic _Sound Experiment_ favourites, ‘Better’ and ‘Redemption’. The performance of ‘Only Wanna Be with You’ was particularly special.   

The show ended with a bang as Samm brought  out Wretch 32 to perform their collaboration, ‘Doubt’. With his debut album surely on the horizon, if you don’t know about Samm Henshaw, get to know!
