Wolf Alice is a band with a diverse set of influences. There are detectable traces of shoegaze, pop, folk, punk, grunge, and indie, to name just a few components of the musical palette brought to bear on this album. 

There is never a dull minute as Ellie Roswell & co. leap from phrase to phrase, always finding a fresh way to voice a line. Roswellâ€™s singing has remarkable range, and everything from the silkiest harmony to the wildest shriek can be found. 

The crew behind the album has undoubtably managed to put together one of the most sonically interesting indie releases this year.
