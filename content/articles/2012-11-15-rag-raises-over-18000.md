     Goldsmith seems to have really turned this round. RAG was unfortunately lacking in past years but the effort and enthusiasm this team have put in is extraordinary. Hope they continue getting the support they need to really make a difference in people's lives

He says there are plans to expand RAG and work with Clubs, Societies & Projects and to hold hall competitions in the future. Goldsmith repeatedly mentioned that RAG was doing “ridiculously well” and that it is going to “make tonnes of money”.
