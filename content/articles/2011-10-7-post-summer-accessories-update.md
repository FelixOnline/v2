__Hats__

Eyes were drawn up and beyond the faces of this season’s models to the hats that flew across the catwalk for AW11/12. Marc Jacobs presented fun plastic berets with a hint of fetish, whilst Dolce and Gabbana strutted sharp androgynous trilbies, adding an edge to their fun and glittery show. Wide brims offset decorative collars at Nina Ricci and Lanvin, creating a sense of mystery and glamour. On a warmer note, Christopher Bailey perched simple furry caps above a sea of multicolored coats at Burberry Prorsum, as Missoni opted for sugar sweet beanies giving the upcoming winter a sprinkle of fairy dust.

Be daring, pick out your look and wear with a generous dose of attitude.

__THE PICK:__
 The deep autumnal shades seen in Gucci’s wide brimmed trilbies with traditional orange feathers nail subtle sophistication to perfection. For a smaller feather to suit smaller wallets, try H&M’s version in deep plum. Pair with a jewel coloured faux fur coat and dark scarlet lips for a nod towards the seventies, or perch above a simple cut dress and boots for an effortless city vibe that will take you from day to night.

__Boots__

As always, when the cold settles in, the boots come out. This season is no different. Deeply luxurious and embellished in jewel coloured velvet, Alberta Ferretti went thigh high with a rich retro feel. Going back to the sixties, Prada incorporated snakeskin and Mary Janes into pair after pair of knee boots as Valentino managed to keep things pretty, matching delicately sheer dresses with beautiful lace covered boots. Isabel Marant preferred the wilder side, and made hers heavily fringed for cool cowboy chic.

Whatever your style, make sure you invest in some good boots. They’re a staple this season and will keep your feet toasty for months to come.

__THE PICK:__
 Textured, tough and with a hint of grunge, Chanel’s boots are perfect for stomping through piles of crunchy leaves. A slight heel adds femininity (not to mention height), yet is still wearable on the slipperiest of frozen days. More affordable variations can be found all over the high street from Zara to H&M. Wear with skinny jeans and a leather coat for the rough and ready biker look, or do like Alexa Chung and team with a cute dress.

__Shoulder Skimming Earrings__

A good outfit is never complete without the right jewellery, and this season designers headed for statement earrings.

The models at Oscar de la Renta hung strings of irregularly shaped gems from their ears skimming the shoulders of beautifully lavish dresses, whilst Marni took a trip back to kinder garden with large coloured disks and hoops contrasting strict, elongated hemlines. Ralph Lauren embraced the east, matching his enchanting rich flowing silk gowns with oriental lucky charms in traditional colours of jade and red. Back in Paris, maturity and simplicity emulated at Sonia Rykiel’s seventies inspired catwalk as classical metallic baubles hung from delicate long chains creating a real sense of Parisian elegance.

Add a hint of red carpet to your look this season, be bold and let your ears take the weight.

__THE PICK:__
 Dolce and Gabbana take home the golden star for their playful crystal encrusted series, an instant buy for any glamorous, fun loving fashionista. Not quite so precious, but still very shiny, Topshop do a brilliant imitation. Throw on your favourite LBD and let these sparkly stars hang above your shoulders, drawing attention to your neck, which is best left clear.

__Dazzling Feet__

Longer hours thrown in the dark may be a cause for concern for some, but not on this seasons catwalks. Jean Paul Gautlier’s metallic kitty heels matched the chignon hair of his models, as they marched down in his colourfully patterned play on smart wear. Prada too displayed elegance in glittering courts, a welcome sight after seasons of feet clad in black, grey and nude. Alexander Wang’s tough cool girls also embraced the shine, parading silver caped stilettos to match their heavy billowing coats. Of course, not to be out-shone, Vivienne Westwood joined the fun as heavily sequined feet strutted down a similarly stunning gold-covered catwalk, light bouncing of every surface creating a scene of brilliant luxury and richness.

Whether it reminds you of the glamorous seventies or your dream wedding, live like a fairy tale and let your feet shine.

__THE PICK:__
 Miu Miu dazzled this season, teaming long sophisticated lengths and sharp collars with disco shoes. Kurt Geiger’s platforms are similarly bright and can dress up the simplest of outfits. Wear with a tailored suit for a stunningly powerful take on this season’s androgynous look.
