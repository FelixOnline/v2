Dear freshers, welcome to London. And to those returning, welcome back. And what a way to kick off the misery that is October with British Film Institute’s (BFI) stunning 57th London Film Festival. With films that are sure to be contenders when it comes to the big awards, the London Film Festival has that rare appeal of having a huge public presence. It’s easy to score some tickets (although the big gala screenings might be fully sold out by now), so keep an eye out for those screenings that will be shown all across central London cinemas.
 This year, London will be graced with the presence of the legendary Tom Hanks who is both opening and closing the festival with his new films. Other key talents expected to attend include Emma Thompson, Judi Dench, Sandra Bullock, Joel & Ethan Coen, Carey Mulligan, Ralph Fiennes, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, amongst many, many more. So roll out the red carpets and watch this space as Felix Film attends various press screenings to bring you the most up-to-date reviews of films from the Festival.
 The Festival is also known for helpfully classifying each participating film into different themes: this year consisting of Love, Debate, Dare, Laugh, Thrill, Cult, Journey, Sonic and Family. So plenty for everyone to choose from!
 For more information regarding tickets and venues, visit the festival website _bfi.org.uk/lff_ or call 020 7928 3232. Good luck, have fun, and make sure you send us your thoughts on whatever film you manage to watch - _film.felix@imperial.ac.uk_

###  Opening Night Gala: Captain Phillips

Directed by Paul Greengrass, a man who knows how to make expert thrillers with budgets both big (The Bourne Supremacy, The Bourne Ultimatum) and small (United 93), Tom Hanks plays the real-life American Captain Phillips whose cargo ship was seized by Somalian pirates. What ensues is tense stand-off, gut-wrenching survival drama, and a heart-thumping rescue mission that may or may not go as planned. Watch as Hanks heroically stands off against the villains and looks out for safety of his ship’s crew.

###  Closing Night Gala: Saving Mr Banks

Ever wondered how ‘Mary Poppins’ the novel became Mary Poppins the hit musical film starring Julie Andrews, which won her the Best Actress Oscar? Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) must negotiate and compromise wisely with the author of the novel, P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson) to bring her words to screen, by no means an easy task as creative control over the published work proves difficult. Word is, the film is full of wonderful performances, heartwarming insight, and an entertaining behind-the-scenes story.

###  Accenture Gala: 12 Years a Slave

Director Steve McQueen has had tremendous successes in the past with Hunger and Shame and for his third feature he seems to have struck gold with his unflinching, brutal, and powerful telling of the true story of Solomon Northup’s harrowing life as a slave. Already a smash-hit at Toronto, Chiwetel Ejiofor’s powerful leading performance has been praised, as well as McQueen’s frequent collaborator Michael Fassbender’s chilling portrayal of a ruthless plantation owner. Get your hopes up for this one.

###  Centrepiece Gala: Inside Llewyn Davis

Having already received quite the critical acclaim at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, the Coen brothers’ new hit will be screened in London. A melancholic, soulful look at the American folk music scene in the early 1960s, Llewyn (Oscar Isaac) is a struggling musician trying to make it big as a solo artist, although the troubles and obstacles that keep heading his way are preventing him from achieving his goals. Unwanted impregnantion of a married woman, losing of a pet, are examples of what he needs to worry about.

###  American Airlines Gala: Gravity

James Cameron was reportedly floored by the technical marvel of Alfonso Cuaron’s new space drama, so it must be good. In his rave statement he compliments the film’s space photography as well as the human dimension in which the film creates “an absolutely seamless portrayal of a woman fighting for her life in zero gravity”. Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) and Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) are on a mission in space when a freak accident leaves them stranded on limited oxygen. Will they survive?

###

###  May Fair Hotel Gala: Labor Day

Jason Reitman (Juno, Up in the Air, Young Adult) moves away from his usual comfort zone of directing off-beat dramedies for a much darker feature film starring Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin. When a depressed single mother (Winslet) kindly takes in an injured, intimidating man (Brolin, who else?) to their home, this little chance encounter will change everyone’s lives forever, including that of her young son Henry’s (Gattlin Griffith). It’s thrilling, melodramatic, with a hint of romance, all weaved together skillfully.

###

###  American Express Gala: Philomena

Dame Judi Dench once again shows off her never-ending acting prowess in Stephen Frears’ new witty, touching drama about the titular character (Dench) looking for her long lost son she had to give up for adoption decades ago. Steve Coogan provides support as a journalist helping her on her journey, and the two strike up an unlikely friendship along the way. A film that “breaks your heart and then repairs it”, it’s no wonder the Weinstein brothers snatched this up to release in time for the competitive Oscar race.

###

###  Festival Gala: The Invisible Woman

Ralph Fiennes’ sophomore directorial effort deals with the final few years in Charles Dickens’ (Fiennes) life, when he reportedly shacked up with a mistress (Felicity Jones) young enough to be his daughter. Scandalous back during the time of traditional values, their relationship had to be a secret which is why very little is known of the actual relationship. But Fiennes bravely tackles the theme with strong performances and a potent period mood to mesmerise and captivate the audience.
