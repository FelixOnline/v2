     说道：I have learned some new isuses from your web siteabout pcs. Another thing I've always believed is that laptop computers have become an item that each residence must have for most reasons. They offer convenient ways to organize households, pay bills, search for information, study, pay attention to music and also watch television shows. An innovative technique to complete these tasks is to use a mobile computer. These pc's are mobile,small, robust and portable.

Margarita is the most common tequila-based cocktail and was most probably invented in Mexico, although there is no solid proof of its origin. We like it in its classic form or with strawberry, pineapple, peach, mango or papaya flavours.

You can enjoy your favourite margarita with a Mexican meal or as a dessert on its own and the good news is that it is very easy to make it at home.

Ingredients:
 - 35 ml Tequila
 - 20 ml Triple Sec
 - 15 ml strawberry juice (or any other juice you prefer)
 - Ice cubes
To make: put everything in the blender until the texture of your cocktail becomes creamy. Rub the rim of the glass with a lime slice, add some salt on it, and carefully pour the mix into the glass.

Now sit back and enjoy. Viva Mexico!
