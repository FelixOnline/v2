Imperial has opened a new centre for ICT innovation at Imperial West.

This new centre is called London Node and it hopes to bridge the gap between the research that is taken and the delivery of the products commercially.

Paul Jenkins, the director of Node said: “This new Node will allow us to establish a focus for ICT innovation in the UK with a European scope. I look forward to working alongside the Node partners, EIT ICT Labs and our European partners, as well as the existing innovation ecosystem, as part of this important project”

London Node will help nurture in research, innovation and excellence in education. This will be achieved through facilitating contact between businesses and academic research as well as providing links to funding.

The founding partners of London Node are Imperial, UCL, University of Edinburgh, Institute of Sustainability, Vodafone, BT, IBM and Intel. There are six other Nodes located within Europe, these being in Berlin, Paris, Trento, Eindhoven, Stockholm and Helsinki; they bring together top universities within Europe, research centres and ICT companies.
