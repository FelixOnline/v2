 - A nice intro I hate to be the arsehole to point it out but I believe its an Attila the Hun not a Trevor Nunn

Wow! That’s all I can say! This is my first issue, and I’m continuing the Felix spirit by writing this editorial just before I send the paper off to the printers.  
 This first issue has been a huge learning curve and a fantastic way to stress and scream (well, moan), something I haven’t been able to do since last term.  
 So, welcome Freshers (and returning readers) to Imperial College 2013/14! The summer has certainly been eventful in terms of a new series of Big Brother (although personally I don’t watch such tripe, anymore), a very rainy week or two in September (with many more to come I’m sure) and exam results both for current students and our new cohort of younglings. Congratulations, you made it through your exams with minimal fatal injury and have made it to campus! It makes me feel like an old man, but I have to tell you Freshers, cherish your years at Imperial (especially your first year, things only get harder from here). Yes, you will be leaving behind old friends and loved ones, but look at the amazing opportunities you have here: Life-changing friendships, a chance to make a real-life nemesis, a fresh leaf and a chance to really maximise your life’s potential. You might think you’ve worked out your identity already and maybe you even walk around hinking you’ve already sorted out your life plan, but don’t be so certain. You’ll meet such a wide variety of people and be able to take part in so many different activities (we have over 300 clubs for goodness sake!) that you’ll find yourself changing into a new person over the course of the year.  
 Now, as much as you’re here to have fun, apparently you’re also here to study as well, or so I’ve heard. Granted, Imperial College is a place of learning, and, as you’ll see in the features section we’re doing pretty well for ourselves in the worldwide rankings, however sometimes we forget that learning doesn’t just have to take place in the library. Not to say that you shouldn’t study but I hope that over the course of the next few years while you work towards your Geoff Hurst or your Trevor Nunn (or your Desmond, ouch) you also take time out to do something fun, like write for Felix. That’s not shameless plugging, honest.  
 That said you’ll find your time here at Imperial very stressful, but don’t be afraid to ask for help if you’re struggling, your department has excellent support staff who are often very friendly, and the Union also has a support service and is available to give advice to students, as well as providing cheap cider and a place to hang out.  
 It’s time for me to stop writing now, the printer’s about to call and I don’t like to keep him waiting. Especially since he might not print the issue, look at what you might have missed out on! Anyway, I hope you have a fantastic time at Imperial and on behalf of all the students who work at Felix, welcome to Imperial College! We hope you’ll enjoy reading Felix each week and maybe you’ll even get involved!
