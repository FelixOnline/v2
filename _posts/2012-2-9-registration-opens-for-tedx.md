Ticket prices for TEDxImperialCollege have been revealed as [registration](http://tedximperialcollege.com/registration/) opens today. Tickets for students will be £10, while all others will pay £25. It has also emerged that Google is to be the main sponsor of the event.

The organisers have stressed that registration doesn’t guarantee a ticket. “Registering means you’ll get advance notice of when ticket sales open. If you haven’t registered, you won’t be able to buy a ticket”, said organiser Kadhim Shubber. He declined to specify when ticketing would open, but hinted it would be around the end of February, and beginning of March.

So far only 5 of the [speakers](http://tedximperialcollege.com/speakers/) have been revealed. These include John Graham-Cumming, the man behind Plan 28, a project to build Charles Babbage’s Analytical Machine for the first time; and Andrew Shoben, founder of greyworld, a group of artists that create large-scale public art – most notably The Source at the London Stock Exchange. “We’ll be revealing the other speakers one-by-one in the coming weeks,” said Kadhim Shubber.

TEDxImperialCollege will be held on March 24 in the Great Hall.
