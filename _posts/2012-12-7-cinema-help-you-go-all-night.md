And you thought you were done with staying up late sipping coffee staring at a screen? Except this time the screen’s 33ft, and it hasn’t got tomorrow’s lab report minimized while reddit gently soothes your woes. Imperial Cinema brings you six of the latest releases, back-to-back, for your chance to catch up on the recent blockbusters. With the added challenge of trying to decipher the mind of Joss Whedon at 6am.

Just before finishing for the holidays, Imperial Cinema gives you one last chance to prove your All-Nighter chops. After all, that’s what all those sleepless nights at the Library were for, not for your degree that’s for sure. So here’s a guide to the All-Nighter, more valuable than having Bear Grylls with you to explore the North Pole.
## Looper
So you’ve turned up to the Union Concert Hall, found a seat or two to nestle in like a hibernating bear, only the coolest bear on the block has this winter entertainment setup. Kicking things off is the sci-fi action thriller Looper. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a “looper”, a hitman hired to kill those sent back from his future. It’s best not to ask questions about the physics and just enjoy this rare smart sci-fi action film.

_Rotten Tomatoes – 94%_
## Skyfall
As the memories of Bruce Willis crawling through the vents in Die Hard come flooding back, you feel like you need another hit of action to take the edge off. Imperial Cinema gladly hands you what you need. Daniel Craig reprises his role as Mr Bond, which sees the franchise firmly ground Bond in the 21st century while also questioning whether espionage and exploding pens really fit in with the age of cyber terrorism.

_Rotten Tomatoes - 92%_
## The Perks of Being a Wallflower
Time for a coffee and some food for your action come down. The shakes slowly fade as you ask for a coffee, shaken not stirred, and get called a twat. Time for some childhood reflection. Based on Stephen Chbosky’s coming of age novel, this often clichéd subject feels sincere rather than sickly with angst. Emma Watson shows she’s more than just a footnote in the Harry Potter universe, but a rising young star.

_Rotten Tomatoes – 86%_
## Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted
Now the true All-Nighter begins, it’s all about pride, showing how hard you are at staying up late and ooooo talking animals. Third in the animation series, the Madagascar cast return with what manages to be a fresh animation that decides to do away with making sense and sticks to the absurdity of it all.

_Rotten Tomatoes– 79%_
## Lawless
After updating your Amazon wish list with all the Madagascar beanie babies, glad you brought your sleeping bag and PJs, it’s time to grit your teeth for the 5th or “nap time” film.

Tom Hardy proves he doesn’t sound like David Attenborough on steroids in this prohibition era movie. Based on thetrue story of the Bondurant Brothers, who get in too deep once the mob and the law come down on their bootlegging business.

_Rotten Tomatoes – 68%_
## The Cabin in the Woods
With a cup of instant coffee grounds, because to hell with water diluting your coffee, and a firm slap to the face, it’s time for the final stretch. Not your standard horror fair, this genre bending film twists and turns like no other and only tries to unravel horror movie clichés.

_Rotten Tomatoes - 91%_
## The End
If you made it this far: congrats, you can now wear the title Trusted Idol Rector of Extended Days, or TIRED for short. It’s time to step out of that nest you made, now resembling a hobo lair with Pot Noodles and cups of questionable liquid scattered about. Time for the SCR to fill you up to the brim with a fried breakfast before going to bed. Fair warning: attempting lectures in this state will only end badly, with you being escorted out of the building, raving about seeing unicorns frolic with jelly babies. Sleep deprivation will give you some crazy ass hallucinations but my god you will never sleep better.
