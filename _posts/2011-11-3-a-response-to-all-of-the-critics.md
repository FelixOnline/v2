I must say; I was rather taken aback by the hullabaloo caused by [my (somewhat overemphasised) opinions](http://felixonline.co.uk/tv/1521/jeremy-kyle-guests-should-cease-breeding/) when I reviewed the Jeremy Kyle show a few weeks ago, and for that, I extend my apologies to anyone who was offended by it. I have never professed to be any good at this writing malarkey – evidently my tongue-in-cheek style and exaggeration were not recognised by some people. Oh well!  
 For those of you unaware, in short, my article said that the point of the Jeremy Kyle show is to make you laugh at the participants (this is patently obvious from every single camera shot of the audience). It also highlighted the fact that it elevates the viewer’s ego. I may have also vaguely mentioned my opinion that not many participants are actually good, decent, hardworking people (it really was very subtle, I’d be surprised if you noticed it).

As expected there was some [negative feedback online](http://felixonline.co.uk/tv/1521/jeremy-kyle-guests-should-cease-breeding/#commentHeader)... slightly more than anticipated but nevertheless, these things happen! I think my favourite comment was as follows: “[I] hope to never see such awful dehumanisation and hideous treatment of fellow humans in Felix again”. Other commentators generally flocked towards this opinion and thus a prevailing hypothesis was formed; that I, George Barnett, am entirely to blame for the way in which guests on the Jeremy Kyle show are portrayed, treated and “dehumanised”.

If, by enjoying the show for the merits in which the producers expect it to be enjoyed, I am dehumanising the guests, then what on Earth are Jeremy Kyle and the ITV production crew doing to them? Helping them? No, that’s not it. Well not entirely anyway. Baiting them to provide entertainment for others? Oh, there we go! Even ‘Angry Geek’ [pointed out](http://felixonline.co.uk/comment/1572/low-class-versus-no-class---jeremy-kyle-and-felix-tv/) that “the production team heavily cherrypick their guests to maximise whatever effect they’re going for that week”. It seems then, that we, the blissfully ignorant viewer, have fallen into ITV’s cunning programming trap! Oh, damn and blast!
> How many of you have written to ITV to complain?
Many of the negative comments on my article pointed the finger at me – fair enough, I wasn’t exactly polite about the guests – but they didn’t point the finger at anyone else who watches the Jeremy Kyle show. Surely they are as much to blame as I am? Okay maybe not quite as much... Nevertheless, here is a question for those people: how many of you have written to ITV to complain about how The Jeremy Kyle Show dehumanises, mistreats and generally makes a mockery of its guests? It would be much to my surprise if any of you had even thought about doing such.

It’s all well and good telling me that I’m in the wrong for the tone I used, or how “vile and hateful” my review was, but what use is that? It may dissuade me, or even someone else, from writing articles of a similar ilk for the next few months. But what’s the point if people continue to watch the show for what it is – “human bear baiting”? Too many people are willing to point the finger and condemn the actions of others solely for the purpose of occupying what they perceive to be the moral high ground. If you negative commentators really believe in what you said, then all I ask of you is to write to ITV and complain about the show.

I have to say, it was much to my delight when the following week, a certain apoplectic nerd took it upon themself to write an article which was in essence a personal attack aimed directly at me. Which is fine, because it was much more interesting than the usual shit churned out by aforementioned author (sorry, but I don’t think I’m the only one with this opinion). So if my article was condemned for being offensive...then why was it okay for the cowardly Angry Geek to write an offensive article directly aimed at me behind the refuge of their cheap nom de plume?

Angry Geek “hates us all” (this is supposedly a “baseline”) – surely there’s reason for this hate? Do we not share your opinions about something, Mr. Angry? I’m guessing not. That’s why you hate us, because we don’t agree with you, right? Are we not worthy of being your equals oh esteemed angry one?

You’ll have to bear with me for the rest of this paragraph, I fear that some of you may not agree... right – here goes. The way I see it is that, by hating everyone (for whatever reason it may be), you segregate yourself from everyone else, which by default creates a divide. Now, whether you consider yourself above, below or even aside from everyone else, you are still separated from them. Still with me? Good. So saying that I promote inequality is a bit sanctimonious and hypocritical, isn’t it?

My conclusion is two-fold. To those negative commentators: if you’re going to do something, then do something worthwhile. Don’t write personal comments or attacks from your perceived moral high ground. Take action against the root of the problem, ITV, not the intermediary. And to Angry Geek, I put it to you to join us, stop being a coward and reveal your identity! Enlighten us. Come on, it’ll be fun! You know you want to! We can have a proper debate about what really annoys us instead of communicating like monkeys with typewriters.
