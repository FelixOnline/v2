This Sunday, IC tennis sent forth social players into the world of competitive tennis for the first time. Our six hopeful challengers ventured to Roehampton, where they would take on counterparts from across West London in a series of singles and doubles matches. The fledgling players showed no fear in this new environment, coming out on top in seven of the ten games, winning the tournament and proving our dominance of the social tennis scene. This competition, the first of its kind, was an incredible success, with players enjoying music and free food throughout the day. Twice as many social tennis players will compete again in December at the University of Brunel to defend their title.
