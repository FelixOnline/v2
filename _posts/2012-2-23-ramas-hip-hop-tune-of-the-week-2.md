In a week where there have been many tracks surfacing from artists of whom I am a big fan, picking one in particular has been tough. Ultimately though there can only be one ‘Rama’s Hip Hop Tune of the Week’ and it comes from someone I only came across for the first time this week whilst bored and surfing the internet.

As [his tumblr](http://kentondunson.tumblr.com/) helpfully informs me __Dunson__, formerly known as Kenton Dunson, is an investment advisor turned rapper from Maryland. ‘Count On It’, the first release from his up-coming mixtape _The Investment _features a sample of the song ‘Pinball Number Count’ which many will recognise from _The Count in Sesame Street_. As a fan of the children’s TV show I would have been sold on the song based on the sample alone however __Dunson__’s delivery and lyrics on this track are impressive and with tight production from __Phatboiz__ this song is a definite winner.
