I have good news for the chocolate-lovers; the biggest celebration of chocolate in the UK is on its way! A wonderful opportunity for the public to learn more about the chocolate market in the UK and have fun in a unique way.

The highlight of the week, is the [Chocolate Unwrapped](http://www.chocolateweek.co.uk/chocolate-unwrapped/) show where visitors can immerse themselves in the spectacular world of chocolate. The very best of British and international chocolatiers will exhibit their stunning and creative chocolate art and provide chocolate tastings, experiences and demonstrations for the visitors. All these, will happen under one roof at the price of £8 only if you book it online, on Saturday at 11:00 - 19:00 and on Sunday at 11:00-17:00, at Vinopolis in London.

You can receive free entry to the show if you participate at the Chocolate Cake competition that is open to all home bakers (amateurs only). The winner will receive signed copies of the judges books, a trophy and the honour of having their recipe published on the [Chocolate Week website](http://www.chocolateweek.co.uk). The competition is limited to just 30 entrants, so you must get your entry in asap to be in with a chance of taking part in the fun. Closing date for entry forms is Wednesday October 13 and the entrants must arrive with an 8-inch diameter cake by midday on Sunday October 16.

Except from the above, there are many more events organized by the participants. If you have a passion for chocolates or you simply want to see something different, then the following events may be of great interest to you.

Firstly, the week starts with [La Maison Du Chocolat](http://www.lamaisonduchocolat.co.uk/uk/en/) Luxury Tasting experience, at 15:00 on October 8 at La Maison du Chocolat boutique, in Piccadilly. There you will trace the steps of the creation of chocolate from the harvesting of the fruit from the cacao tree, to the creation of chocolates with refined ingredients. They promise to prepare for you couvertures, finished ganaches and pralines to try, for the price of £50 for the whole session.

You shouldn’t miss the free in-store mini tasting sessions that will take place at 16:30 from October 10-16 at La Maison du Chocolat boutique, in Piccadilly.

[Divine Chocolate](http://www.divinechocolate.com/default.aspx) is going to treat its chocoholic friends with various ways especially prepared for the chocolate week. From the 10th until the 16th of the month, at various locations in London, like Shepherd’s Bush and Westminster, you will have the chance to enjoy delicious Divine cocktails, chocolate packages, body chocolate exfoliations and chocolate pedicures.

[Artisan du Chocolat](http://www.artisanduchocolat.com/) has scheduled a half an hour tutored tasting that commences with a brief history of chocolate followed by sampling of their new Columbian bars and limited edition truffle, at 12:00 on October 10, 12, and 13 at Selfridges, Oxford Street.
