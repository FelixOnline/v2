I don’t know a lot about you and to be honest I don’t really care (only kidding…no really, I don’t care). but I was fortunate enough to spend Christmas in Les Alpes. Personally, and unsurprisingly (being a wannabe food critic) my favorite part was the food. So again I have another gem of a recipe to share!

__Tartiflette__

For those of you that ski, I’m sure you are familiar with this. Really, is there anything much better than coming after a long day on the slopes, grabbing a pint and a decent bit of tartiflette? No, didn’t think so.

It’s very simple, to make this for at least four people all you need is a bag of potatoes (1.5 kg) an onion, a knob of butter, some bacon (about 3-4 rashers) and a whole Reblechon. This is a French round cheese available in most supermarkets. (If you can’t find Reblechon, then Gruyere or Emmenthal can work just as well too).

– Preheat the oven to gas 5 or around 200°C.

– Now wash the potatoes and slice into 1 cm strips. Boil for about 5-10 minutes in boiling water with a pinch of salt.

– Next, dice the onion finely and chop the bacon into lardons before frying these together with a nice knob of butter in an ovenproof medium depth frying pan. Once the onion and bacon is suitably fried (not ‘caramelized’), layer the potatoes on top so the whole of the pan is covered. Season well.

– Get your Reblechon and cut the whole thing into strips, but remember to leave the rind on.

– Put the strips of cheese over the potatoes and put in the oven for 20 minutes so it melts completely. It’s done!

– Serve with a fresh green salad topped with French vinaigrette with a buttered chunk of a rustic baguette. Perfect.

There you go, you have a creamy, gooey and very filling meal that will make you want to hit the slopes. Guaranteed. Not long until December then. Enjoy!
