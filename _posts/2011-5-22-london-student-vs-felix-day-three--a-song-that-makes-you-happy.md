The reaction when I play someone this [Star Slinger](http://www.starslinger.net/home.html) song is always the same: "Holy shit that's awesome!" they say in not so many words. The song (and its video) makes me happy for two reasons:

1. It's full of summery cheer and makes you want to jump out of bed and run around in a field (accompanied by lots of lens glare and weird psychedelic patterns).

2. It's a gateway drug to a whole lot of other Star Slinger tunes – like [this Gold Panda remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jwoOODS0TQ)

_The London Student and Felix are [currently fighting an epic war](http://felixonline.co.uk/music/1210/london-student-vs-felix-30-day-challenge/).

__Look out for Felix's interview with Star Slinger in next week's issue.__
