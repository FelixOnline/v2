Gracefully floating from synth to drums, TALA immediately made the stage her own, pouring every part of herself into her singing, lyrics and production.

The ICA often plays host to multidisciplinary artists, but TALA has honed a single craft, the ability to reconstruct an electronic song single-handedly live on stage. There may have been some trickery behind the scenes; regardless, TALA showed how one woman can dominate a space and captivate an audience.

On her numerous EPs she explores pop music to its fullest. There are clear similarities to M.I.A., but TALA doesn’t let this define her. She’s more influenced by her own Iranian heritage than by the music of her contemporaries.

As only her second live show, it was all the more impressive. Leaving the stage smiling, it was obvious that TALA was pleased with her performance.

On ‘Enya Ayez (You Wish)’ she exclaims “I hope, I hope, that the whole world’s watching.” Give it a few years and the everyone will be under her spell.
