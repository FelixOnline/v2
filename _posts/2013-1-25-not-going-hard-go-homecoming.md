Fellow students! Fancy an opportunity to enjoy a night experiencing the unique Singaporean culture while donating money to charity? Then wait no longer! The Imperial College Singapore Society proudly presents Major Event 2013: Homecoming, the annual event in the Imperial College Singapore Society’s Calendar. This year it comes in the form of a musical, named “Homecoming”. It promises to be a light-hearted show with good fun and music as we take you through the lives of 5 students, trying to make their way back home. There will be love, laughter and lots of singing and dancing so be prepared for a wonderful time! It will be a showcase of our Singaporean culture, our quirks, our quarks, and our very unique “Singlish” will be liberally dispensed, so what are you waiting for? Get your tickets at the Singapore Society’s Union site or look out for us at JCR from next week! All proceeds will go to Save the Children, UK. More details are available on www.facebook.com/majorevent2013. See you on the 2nd!
