In the wake of last Friday’s horrific attacks on Paris, it’s important that we remain calm and collected when dealing with our enemies. To defeat terrorism we need a well thought out and multilateral response. Instead, on Saturday, Francois Hollande responded with a futile act of revenge. By bombing ISIS and declaring war, we prove their world view, that the world is black and white, and play into the insidious narrative of us versus them.
> We arbitrarily value certain lives over others
Just two days after the death of 132 innocent civilians, the French military launched fresh strikes on the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa in Syria. There is no doubt that the militants killed in this attack were awful human beings, but it’s sad that so soon after a tragedy we are willing to respond with such destructive violence. It seems as if the violence of the west is far more palatable than those who oppose us. We should treat all murder with similar disgust.

Moreover, we must question the effectiveness of airstrikes in combating ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The American and French bombing campaigns seem to have done little to stop the terror that ISIS create. In fact, they seem to have inspired more people to join the terrorist group. Airstrikes are merely a simple, public appeasing, and largely inadequate solution to a complex problem. So, it’s worrying that David Cameron now seeks to involve Britain in the same nationalistic display of military power.

When we drop death from above, it invariably results in the slaughter of innocent civilians. Not only is it immoral, but when you kill someone’s brother, aunt, or grandmother you are likely to create more allies for ISIS on the ground. Although we don’t do it intentionally, we arbitrarily value certain lives over others and we continue to justify accidental deaths as necessary by-products of war. The recent attack on the Kunduz hospital in Afghanistan that left 22 dead proves that our military is not yet capable of reducing civilian casualties to ‘acceptable’ levels.

Sometimes the people we attack have already proven their guilt. But instead of bringing the perpetrators of heinous attacks to account, we respond with wrath and fury. In these cases we have the ability to truly distinguish ourselves from the barbarity of our enemies.

The last thing ISIS want us to do is to bring them to trial and surely in the case of Mohammed Emwazi (Jihadi John), a British citizen, we should have dealt with their crimes under British law, rather than under state-conducted vigilantism.

If we allow the warmongering rhetoric of our leaders and media to continue then we will never be able to defeat terrorism in its current form. A single civilian casualty should never be accepted nor should we respond with vengeance. We cannot play into the hands of ISIS; they yearn for a world of absolutes without a grey area in between.
