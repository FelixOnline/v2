####  CAMPUS FOOD:

There are lots of places to stuff your face like a greedy pig (with glasses on) around campus. Some are even super new so it’s an adventure. Okay, not a good adventure like accidentally walking into an all super model nudist colony, but an adventure nonetheless. [Match the numbers to the locations on the pullout map]

__Union (1)__  
 They serve lunch and dinner food. The food is cheap and almost cheerful. Well. It’s more cheerful than a man with vertigo standing on the top of the Shard. That’s something. Nachos is a good call and the bar staff are all nice.

__Eastside (2)__  
 Just below Eastside Halls, it’s a posh pub, although looks more like an American bar. Serves pretty good food at lunch and dinner that is veggie friendly and meat lover friendly too. The prices are low enough that they probably won’t leave you offering £2 blow jobs on High Street Ken just to get by. So that’s a plus.

__JCR__  
 This is, realistically, where you’ll end up eating most days. It has all you could want and more. A bunch of sandwiches, a deli bar (which is actually surprisingly good) and even a pie and mash/salad bar shop. Back in the day you could do the mash yourself, now they check, just incase you scam them out of 5p’s worth of potato. You’ve been warned. There’s also a fast food counter, if you’re into that sort of thing. By that, I mean rejected KFC food. There’s a pancake place too, but they aren’t proper crepes really: it’s essentially rubber with some Nutella on top. Yum yum.

__QTR__  
 If you want hot food then this is your place to go. It always has a noodle based option, and a meal deal. You get a drink, dessert and a main for pretty cheap. Word of warning though: if you get a hot dessert eat it first so it doesn’t end up going cold – made that mistake too many times. If you want to be a true pro, and piss off the chef a bit, ask for an omelette.

__Library Cafe__  
 Why would I need to go here? I won’t be in the Library long enough to need sustenance. I’ll be out raving with Tinie Tempah and the other freshers. From semester to semester. Where do you think you are? UCL? Nah, you’ll actually be doing work and stuff. So, sorry to say, but, this will become a main eatery. It has all the energy drinks you could want (and many you don’t want). Plus it has wraps that probably won’t kill you. There’s also the infamous jacket potatos. I heard tell of a couple breaking up after sharing one in the Library Cafe. Possibly they broke up because he wanted beans and she wanted cheese and the two together just didn’t work. That became a metaphor for their failing relationship and it had to end. Or one of them cheated on the other. Either way, at least they were full at the end of it. The legends working there pile on the cheese and beans to heroic amounts. So take advantage.

__Department Cafes__  
 Loads of departments have their own cafes. Essentially small counters with tea, coffee, sandwiches and drinks. The SAF Cafe is pretty good. The Business School one too. The others are great for a cheeky chocolate bar to eat in lectures while you try to understand if it is maths or a foreign language being written on the board.

__SCR__  
 This is only for postgrads and lecturers, unfortunately. However, the breakfast is for all. How liberal of them. If you can drag yourself in early enough, give it a go. It’s amazingly cheap and they have everything you could want. The hash browns are gorgeous. You’re missing out if you don’t go. Honestly, try this: pile your plate with everything you could imagine eating. Go to the checkout. Be amazed at how it is still under £5.

__Other__  
 College will be changing some areas by the time you get here so look forward to the new “College Cafe” near the main entrance and a new outlet in the JCR!

#### NEAR CAMPUS FOOD:

Bored of eating the same rotation of three sandwiches and a Twix for lunch and dinner every day? Well you should be. But never fear, there are tales of places not near the Library where one can eat.

__The Sandwich Shop (9)__

This is like a mature student who sucks up to a lecturer: an old favourite. More accurately, though, it’s like a shop that has a bewildering amount of sandwich choices. There’s also Greenfield’s near South Ken station for an artisan sandwich. The goat’s cheese one is a solid bet.

__Caffe Forum__  
 This place has possibly the best pizzas in London. They are thin and yummy. Plus, between 4-7pm they are all £5, no matter what size you get. Amazing right? Also have a large selection of pastas, quiches, and some sandwiches. If you want a morning perk, go for a coffee and get a free croissant. Near Gloucester Road is also The Diner, and a Neros (23) with the comfiest sofas ever. Great for doing work in a chilled environment.

__High Street Ken__  
 There’s anything you could want here. Wagamamas (32) is a good shout – free green tea is a plus. Giraffe (31) are incredibly friendly and have a special Imperial deal (they did last year, don’t kill me if it is no longer there). Just show your College card for a discount. Of course there’s also all the big chains around too.

__South Ken__  
 Oriental Canteen (14) and Chopstix (15) are great for a quick (erm, oily) snack.
