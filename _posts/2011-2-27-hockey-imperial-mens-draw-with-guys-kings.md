The day after the bottle match and at 9:30, Captain yogi was down to 7 players with 4 injuries from the day before. Calling in all the favours, IC managed to scratch 10 together to line up against GKT in the ULU Prem. Division – which IC 1sts can neither win nor lose at this stage in the season.

With nothing much to play for, and the rain coming down, IC were caught unawares at the start - GKT went 1-0 up after 5 minutes, and IC looked in for a miserable day.

However, as IC returned to basics, the confidence began to build, and after a rather interesting diving attempt from goalkeeper-turned-left-winger ET went wide, and a string of missed short corners, IC managed to find the net with their fourth penalty corner of the game courtesy of a Yogi drag-flick, only for GKT to go ahead again from a short corner.

At half time it was 2-1, and IC rallied – we were far from out of this game as we had expected at the start. As the game opened up, and with some fantastic skills from veteran Diana down the right, IC went level with another drag-flick, and then ahead with RSF smashing it in from the penalty spot. As the second half progressed, tiredness began creeping in, and the game became more and more open – with GKT levelling only to be met with a fantastic response from Yogi and Diana straight from the restart to make the score 4-3 and Yogi completing his hat-trick.

GKT’s frustration at not being well in front to a 10 men scratch team began to show – with a sin bin for a one particularly shouty medic. With 10 v 10, IC were dominant, and stayed 4-3 in front until the final 5 minutes.

Today however, was not the day to win with 10 players, and 2 minutes from time and back to full strength GKT scored an equaliser after a goalmouth scramble. Still 4-4 was a very respectable result which showed fantastic teamwork and character from IC.
