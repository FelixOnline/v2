Welcome back all you holidaying Imperialites. I hope you had a refreshing break or as so many of you were, your revision went well. It's back to the daily grind from now until the end of the academic year with the summer term punctuated by exams and projects.

But enough of that, what did we miss I hear you cry! Well the month of April held a surprising amount of goings on in the consumer electronics space this year including a couple of somethings from Apple, a few tidbits from Microsoft and an absolute deluge from Dell. So without pomp and circumstance, let's get on with it shall we? Roll the press!
