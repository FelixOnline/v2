Last term in the midst of ‘Imperial Girls Can’ week the ICURFC gentlemen headed down to Kent for their last formal game of 2015 in the hope that they could make the ladies of Imperial proud. With our eyes set on the league title the necessity for repeated bonus point wins cannot be stressed enough; the pressure was on. The game opened with a few changes to the regularly fielded side – most notably in the backs with Ed Durkin stepping in at ten. A guest appearance at prop from Eifion Foster got the horns blowing when he put Hobson over the line for the first score of the game and the second score of his life. The Sonny\-Bill offload brought an orchestrated applause from the crowd; an impressive start for IC.

The game evolved gently in the first half with College chopping the opposition’s chances of victory through a driving maul touched down by Joe McGrail. Club Captain Charles Price\-Smith proved to Link up well with Moorby in the centres, bursting through the line for the third score.

The second half saw the Imperial boys hunting for that invaluable bonus point try. The bells rang out of their head\-height towers for Josh O’Donnell when he slid into the corner for the fourth try only to have his dreams swatted as the referee wrongly disallowed what was an incredible score. However, it wasn’t long before this was corrected by Durkin putting Moorby in under the posts to give the kicker a slight chance of converting. The opposition’s chances of recovery were receding faster than Clayton’s hairline when Price\-Smith bundled over for the fifth score of the game. This reassuring victory for IC has kept the promotion prospect within reach – next term would surely see some thrilling rugby.
