On BBC iPlayer until midnight tomorrow (Saturday 13th), is the best film you can see for free this weekend. Starring Harrison Ford as Deckard, the policeman tasked with hunting down a group of escaped androids, banned from earth due to their threat to humanity. The visual palette of this film is an amazing selections of eerie dark shades, with a plot to match. Based loosely on Philip K. Dickâ€™s fantastic Do androids dream of electric sheep, it gives more questions than answers while remaining captivating and enjoyable. A must watch for anyone with a modem. Check it out on <http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer>/
