Mali is in the middle of a crisis. Since the start of 2012, a war of independence has been fought in its northern provinces, known collectively as Azawad. The conflict ended abruptly in April with the ousting of the then President Amadou Toumani Touré, by rebelling soldiers over his handling of the war. The loose alliance of Tuaregs and Islamists (Ansar Dine, a group linked to Al-Qaeda) then declared Azawad an independent state.

The short war led to a dire humanitarian crisis: some 200,000 people are currently displaced, with millions more expected to be affected by drought. Amnesty International, a human rights group, reported instances of gang rape, executions without trial and the use of child soldiers in Azawad.

Besides the human suffering, cultural casualties are also amassing: Islamists seem to be keen on wiping out the UNESCO-recognized Islamic shrines, considered sacred by Sufi muslims. Ansar Dine views these shrines as idolatrous and, thus,inconsistent with their aim of spreading and ruling Azawad by Sharia law.

With such a large humanitarian crisis at hand and the potential for the birth of a Sharia-ruled Al-Qaeda linked state in Saharan Africa, the costs of containing the crisis could never be higher. The government in Mali formally requested for international support, following an Islamist push into southern Mali.

It is reassuring to see that the call for help answered so expediently, with both the African Union and the European Union offering military support to Mali. The French are at the forefront of intervention, already deploying 800 soldiers with hundreds more arriving in the coming days. Air strikes are a daily occurrence. The British and Belgians are providing the French intervention with equipment or technical support.

In addition to the French boots on the ground, thousands of African Union troops are being deployed as well. Neighbouring nations are particularly interested in preventing a terrorist haven from entrenching in their backyards.

Curiously absent from the scene is the United States. As the State Department stated, no direct military aid to Mali can be allocated until leaders are appointed through elections. Though troop deployment does not seem like a possibility, the Pentagon has been collaborating with the French military, providing intelligence from satellite images, as well as intercepted signals.

The foreign involvement in Mali represents an intriguing change in global politics. America no longer views itself as the global police force to every conflict, wisely choosing the cheaper and politically safer option of supporting regional powers to solve their issues. The debt crisis, as well as the legacy of Iraq and Afghanistan, weighs in heavily.

The French, on the other hand, are experiencing a renewed involvement in world affairs as a vocal leader. Qaddafi was toppled with the help of French-led air support, a victory for France and Sarkozy, even if it didn’t keep him in office. French involvement does pose some acute problems, with Islamists threatening attacks upon France itself. President Hollande seems willing to risk the possibility of a terrorist attack and even entertains the possibility of prolonged involvement in Mali, so long as it means the end of a lawless and unstable region so close to home.

For the most part, Malians have welcomed the foreign troops happily. Stabilizing the situation in Azawad would allow closing refugee camps that taxed the south of the country, as well as its neighbours. For the thousands of displaced, it means they can return home.
