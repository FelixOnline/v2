 - The good news is that the room is available whenever their isnt teaching happening There was a period when the room was inaccessible whilst the PCs were being remotely rebuilt by ICT but happy to report if the room is empty all students should be able to swipe in

Computer room 204 in the Library was recently locked as their was training scheduled. The door has a sign saying it is booked. This meant that students were unable to use the computers inside. However, there are days when nobody has been seen in the room. A student complained to the Library staff about this and was told that it belongs to ICT, who have recently started locking it.
