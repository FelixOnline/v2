[Felix is throwing another rocking party](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=214310911933116) at Imperial College Union’s live music venue and all around super-club, Metric, on Saturday 11th June.

Following the success of the first [Felix Music Night - 19.02](http://felixonline.co.uk/music/946/1902-felix-music-night/) - we bring you the most anticipated sequel of the Summer: BONED. Come gaze in awe at our incredible roster of Imperial-based musicians from Jazz n’ Rock and Music Tech, who will perform for you along with our very special guest, Becoming Real.

The line-up for the night is an exciting one, only rivaled by the line-up we had for the original Felix Music Night.

_Special guest:_  
[__BECOMING REAL__](http://www.myspace.com/becomingrealmusic)  
 (Ghost-Step)  
 Alongside James Blake and Mount Kimbie, Becoming Real is defining the landscape of post-dubstep British electronic music, and we are extremely proud to have him perform at the Felix Music Night. If you are looking for the future sound of London’s nightlife, look no further than this brilliant artist. Do not miss it! His unique live performance is unlike any other ‘dance’ artist you wil see this side of Venus.

[__SIMON HUNTER, A.K.A. MONSK__](http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fuser3090840%2F1902-recorded-live&h=f263c)  
 (Badman DJ set)

... And you could play too!  
 Are you in a band? Or are you an amateur beat poet? We are still looking for one last act, so give us a shout if you want to take part in BONED!

We have purposely incorporated many eclectic musical styles in a single night, so as to appeal to as many tastes as possible, but we assure you it all fits together just right. Each set will be kept short and sweet, and the set-up times in between acts will be minimal, giving you a real bang for your buck.

It is to be a celebration of our local musical scene and an opportunity to bond with other music-lovers, share a drink and make new acquaintances. We want this to be a cross-society bonanza of tasty vibes and sweet music.

So that’s 3 bands and 5 DJs: a total of 8 incredible acts, playing all night long for your listening pleasure, and [all for a mere £3](http://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/felix-321/felix-boned-felix-music-night-3017/product.html). Seriously, what more can you ask for?

We chose the date specifically because the vast majority of you will have finished your exams, so there is no excuse for not turning up to a night of fun, kick-ass tunes and great performances. Bring all your friends and their friends: the event is open to everyone, not just for Imperial students. This is the last showcase of Imperial’s musical talent this year, and it is set to be a spectacle of epic proportions.

[Come one, come all, to BONED at Metric on Saturday 11th June 2011. ](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=214310911933116)
