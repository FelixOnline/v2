ICTV’s Jonathon Masters and Hasan Al-Habib managed to wangle a YouTube gem at the Spectre premiere: an interview with Chris Evans.

After being flagged down by Imperial College TV at the end of the red carpet, Evans paused to talk to the roving reporters.

He was handed a microphone by the rookies, which wasn’t plugged into anything, muttering “this is hilarious” before telling the boys he was excited to be joining Top Gear, but was more excited about their microphone.

Evans asked the boys if they’d applied to be a host of the new show, with Al-Habib responding that he was “tempted by Amazon Prime”, the company set to run a show with the original Clarkson/May/Hammond cast.

Chris then, cursing his own interviewing technique, gestured for the camera. Masters obliged without hesitation, and Chris began to film the two.

Taking off his own glasses, he shoved them to Masters, a similarly firey redhead.

Filming himself and the ICTV duo, he exclaimed, “this is the real Chris Evans interview!”

Referring to strawberry blonde Masters, he pleased the crowd, quipping, “that’s what I used to look like!”

“I’m so jealous of his hair, it’s proper ginger hair, mine’s rubbish.”
