 - The reason this interview didnt come off is that it was rushed and sent via email as Ive already admitted a while ago on Twitter httpstwittercomkadhimshubberstatus133248933429395456 It was meant as a bit of irreverent fun to promote a music nightI think you should have researched more about Mikill Pane before interviewing him the lack of knowledge shows here

__Kadhim Shubber: Your website says you’re “non-existent”; what happened, can we help?__

Mikill Pane: I’m just a figment of Justin Smith Uzomba’s vivid imagination and nope, you can’t help. I’ve got all the assistance I need, thanks. Unless you know anyone who’s letting go of a better body than the one I’m currently housed in. I’d quite like to be a sex symbol and Justin’s physique doesn’t quite cut it.

__KS: What’s your story? How did you come to be (or not to be)?__

MP: Justin unwittingly created me as a nemesis for a former alter ego that we won’t speak about for legal reasons.  
  
__KS: Why is pronouncing your name “Mickill” so horrendously wrong?__

MP: Paedophilia is horrendously wrong. Pronouncing my name in such a manner is simply wrong. Just don’t do it and we won’t have any problems.

__KS: What’s wrong with modern hip-hop, and what can Imperial students do to fix it?__

MP: I don’t like most modern hip-hop because I’m rarely interested by any of the subject matter of the tracks I hear. Imperial students can’t do much unless they’re willing to give up their studies and start a mass rap career.

__KS: You seem to shun the whole rapping about “guns and bitches” area of hip-hop; what’s wrong with “guns and bitches”?__

MP: I’ll pretend you didn’t ask that...

__KS: What’s worth and not worth rapping about?__

MP: Rap about anything you like as long as you’re interested in it.

__KS: You wrote some dark and depressing rhymes on the track you did with Ed Sheeran, ‘Little Lady’. What recess of your mind did the 13-year-old prostitute idea come from?__

MP: ‘Little Lady’ was written by Justin’s old alter ego. He’s gone now and he won’t need lyrics wherever he is, so I stole the song. Sue me.

__KS: You’re pretty inked up, tell us a bit about your tattoos.__

MP: There’re way too many. I can tell you that they are, in essence, pigmentation beneath my skin... I hope that info suffices.

__KS: Imperial is a science-only university, so we’re going to end with a short quiz: E equals?__

MP: MC2, but what does Mariah Carey’s eleventh album have to do with science?

__KS: People who believe in creationism are?__

MP: Let’s not make sweeping generalisations.

__KS: Fermat's debut theorem was way better than his last theorem, discuss.__

MP: I'll take your word for it
