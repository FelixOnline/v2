After a convincing win over the RSM last term, the City & Guilds RFC took on Balliol College, Oxford in the annual Gin match. It was to be a day of records; the most number of referees seen in a rugby match and the greatest number of bottles of Gin drunk in one evening. The authoritative word of vice-captain Graeme Ridler stated that the team would meet at 11.50am only for Ridler himself to arrive late.

Upon safe arrival in Oxford, we swiftly made our way to the ground only to discover that no changing rooms were available and, more importantly for Messers Joachim, Jinks and Hill, no toilets. The game finally got underway after a two hour delay. It soon became clear that both teams wanted to play fast-flowing rugby with the C&G having the upper hand in the first half scoring another 3 tries by Nicholas Johnstone and two tries by Scotsman Michael O’Connell who added an extra two points with a difficult drop-goal conversion.

At half-time with C&G leading 24-0, the referee who was also the Balliol captain decided to get in on the action and handed over refereeing duties to another player. The second half was a much tighter affair with the hosts finally putting together some good moves. Strong running by their 8 and 10 saw them dot down two tries to close the gap to 24-10 but soon after O’Connell took his chance to seal his hat-trick. Balliol still didn’t give up but the fierce C&G defense held fast, led bravely by Jinks who made a number of crunching tackles.

Tries by Ridler and Tom Beswetherick rounded off a 44-29 victory for the mighty C&G, not before a third referee was brought into the fray. The victory meant that C&G remain unbeaten this season.

Man of the Match went to Jinks whilst Chris McGeough reclaimed his beloved ‘distinctly average performance’ trophy. Johnstone snatched the Twat of the Match award for attempting a ridiculous drop-goal kick, a trait he has inherited from his brother.
