 - Hey Kate,Looking forward to reading all about it. Could you do me a favor? If you go to the library at MBL, there&#8217;s a quote on the wall&#8230; something about not always looking at books but going outside. Could you post a pic of it? I liked the quote a lot &#8212; especially given the con#8xt&te211; and can&#8217;t remember exactly how it goes.Thanks!

Fact: humans are 90% stardust.

Human beings are mostly made up of water, with a few other bits and pieces
thrown in for good measure. That means we are largely made of Hydrogen atoms,
followed by lots of Oxygen, a fair bit of Carbon, some Nitrogen and a
sprinkling of some more interesting stuff.

Immediately after the big bang, the only elements that existed were Hydrogen
and Helium: everything else was formed over billions of years as a product of
fusion reactions \(when two atoms fuse together to make a single heavier
atom\). These fusion reactions take place in stars, producing heavier elements
such as Oxygen, Nitrogen and Carbon, as well as recycling lots of Hydrogen. The
really heavy atoms – think Gold and Silver – require something a bit more
dramatic, and are made only during the massive energy release of supernovas.

So all those familiar elements – Calcium in your bones and Iron in your blood –
are just bits of leftover stardust made in great balls of fire billions of
years ago. It’s enough to make you feel just a little bit special.
