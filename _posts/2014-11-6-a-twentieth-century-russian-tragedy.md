_I__’ll give you my cheek you’ll want my breast. I’ll give you my breast you’ll want my badger. You’ll work your way down and nothing will stop you’._

Opening on the 10th October, director Katie Mitchell returns to __The Young Vic__ in a production of Russian playwright Anton Chekhov’s final play, _The Cherry Orchard_. Set in 20th century Russia, the play follows an aristocratic Russian matriarch and her family in the midst of losing their beloved country estate along with its immense cherry orchard.

Initially devised as a comedy, the play’s original director, Stanislavski, saw it more as a tragedy and it is this interpretation that influences Mitchell’s current portrayal. The set is cold and gloomy with the once grandiose house now haggard and poorly illuminated.

Chekhov explores many themes in the play: nature, modernity, personal identity and the effect of social change.

Several works of the period commented on the clash of old Russia and ‘modern’ Western values and so many deemed the play to be Chekhov’s commentary on a society unwilling to adapt to a modern Russia, primarily through his depiction of Lady Ranevskaya and her downright refusal to save the country estate.

The play is stolen by Gawn Grainger in his portrayal of Firs, an elderly and frail serf who has worked for the family for many years. Now barely able to walk, his years of devotion and dedication to the family make the final tragedy of loneliness all the more painful.

Whilst scattered with light comedic moments, an overwhelming darkness predominates. Stephens has considerably shortened the play, 2 hours in all, which serves to avoid any moments of dullness.

The play is ideal for both Chekhov virgins and veterans alike and the hard-hitting conclusion is sure to linger in your mind whatever your experience.

_The Cherry Orchard (Dir: Katie Mitchell) is on at The Young Vic until 29th November. Monday-Saturday, 7.30pm, Matinees on Wednesday and Saturday._

_Tickets are available online, priced from £10-35_
