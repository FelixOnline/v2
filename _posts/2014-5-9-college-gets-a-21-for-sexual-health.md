 - Since when is it Imperials responsibility to educate its students on sexual health Surely everyone learns this sort of thing at secondary school or earlierWhat is this sexual heath information theyre expecting on the campus Condom usage posters in the disabled toilets Popup images of diseased genitals when you log in to the college PCs Agreed Patronising to the max not Colleges jobGood advert for Superdrug though If I was a cynical person I would suggest that was their motive for doing the surveyAnd far from highlighting an issue I suspect many of us would be delighted with a 21

In a Superdrug study of sexual health provision by universities nationwide College was rated 14th and provided with a 2:1 classification.

Using a list of the top 50 universities (as listed by the Good University Guide), Superdrug rated them against nine criteria regarding sexual health provision for students.

Receiving 63 points, a full 17 points behind table leaders Bristol University, College’s lowest score, F, was received in _Sexual Health Information Found On Campus_, while College received a D for the ease of finding sexual health information on its website.

In total seven universities received a ‘first class degree’ from Superdrug’s Online Doctor, while half of the group received a 2:1 or better.

Some of the main problems observed by the researchers compiling the table included the fact the universities were often not involved in sexual health campaigns or provision, leaving it to elected welfare officers who change every year. Also, they pointed out that while many universities provide a good sexual health service, they often don’t promote it enough or do not give detailed information.
