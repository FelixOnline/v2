“Hiya! Do you have a few moments to volunteer for a good cause?“ “Ah sorry I’m in a hurry” This dialogue has occurred in the JCR for too long. And as students, who are stereotypically drunk 24/7, it is time for us to stand up and change public perceptions.

The National Student Volunteering Week (SVW) is taking place next week. Imperial will be one of many universities over the UK to celebrate the positive impact made by student volunteers in their communities, raise awareness of the value of student volunteering and inspire more students to get involved. A group of Imperial Hub SVW Champions and I have been working together since November to deliver a fun-packed programme for you all next week!

We all know why we should volunteer. It provides a great warm feeling to be able to give something back to the community and make a difference to people who are less fortunate than us. According to recent figures volunteering contributes £4.8 billion to UK GNP, and many charities just could not carry out the initiatives they have without the help of volunteers. Volunteering not only contributes a social impact to the community, but also economically to the country.

But what most people forget is that volunteering is a two-way process. Yes, a lot of it is about you giving your time and effort, but throughout the journey you will earn invaluable skills and meet amazing people, as well as having some some fun away from labs and destressing!

Volunteering increases your exposure to the world, since different opportunities uncover different social issues. Being around one of the wealthiest boroughs in London, it might be easy to assume that everything is fine. We see big expensive cars on the road, school children wearing their hats on scooters and, of course, the many shoppers coming out of Harrods with expensive handbags and cutlery.

The truth of the matter is, the life expectancy at St. Charles is nine years lower than that of the Queens Gate area, though it is only a short 30 minute bus trip away. Life expectancy says a lot when it comes to the living standards and welfare of residents and this just uncovers the deep social issues on our doorstep. The more knowledge we have on the surroundings, the more informed decisions we can make in life. Personally, since volunteering with Imperial Hub, I have changed quite a few of my habits and make more ethical choices day to day.

If you are ready to move on to a higher level, being a volunteer manager is even more rewarding. Whether you are coordinating a regular community project or being a club officer in your clubs and societies, the experience provides you with many transferrable skills, from effective communication, to problem solving, to planning and organising events. Being Imperialites, we can receive training through the Union’s Imperial Plus scheme, as well as the weekly Lunch and Learn sessions by Imperial Hub.

These programmes not only recognise the time and effort you have put into volunteering, but also the different skills you have gained, with both schemes offering the opportunity to gain qualifications. Not to mention the privilege to be nominated for Community Connections Volunteer of the Year at the annual Union Awards!

Many of you who have started looking for jobs would have encountered competency questions. What could be a better answer than your volunteering experience to show that you are a rounded young professional? In fact, a survey has shown that amongst 200 of the UK’s leading businesses, 73% of the employers would hire someone with volunteer experience over someone without, and 94% of employees who volunteered to learn new skills had benefited either by getting their first job, improving their salary, or being promoted; a reminder that your time spent volunteering now may be paid back in the future.

All sounds good and ready to give it a go? Well you’re not alone! Currently almost 400 students take part in over 35 different opportunities, many of whom are regular volunteers – for example, Schools Plus tutors last year collectively spent 1340 hours tutoring kids from a poorer background, inspiring the next generation of scientists and engineers. Have a look at what some of the volunteers have said and why they enjoy it so much!

Last year, 100% of SVW volunteers agreed that participating in SVW had been a positive experience for them, so it’s now time for you to get involved!

Also, is there someone who has given their time to make a positive impact on your time at Imperial? Come to the stall and take part in The Great Volunteer Thank You. All you need to do is write your message on our thank you postcards and we will deliver your appreciations to them!

All attendees will be invited to our Thank you event, where you will be joined by some of the regular volunteers, as well as some of our beneficiaries.

__If you don’t have much time__

Desk to Difference – don’t have enough time to volunteer? Come along to our lunchtime drop in and write a letter to a child in hospital or answer queries from visually impaired people through an iPhone app. Drop in sessions on Tuesday (SAF 121) and Thursday (SAF 120) lunchtime next week.

Bring non-perishable food items to Sherfield Foyer to be donated to local food bank on Friday!
