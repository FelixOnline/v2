Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has pulled out from a talk scheduled for this Sunday. The College had approved the talk, [after initially rejecting an earlier date](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/1294/college-await-police-advice-on-musharraf-talk/), but imposed severe restrictions, including only allowing College members to attend and preventing online publicity, except through Clubs’ member email lists.

Organiser Hussain Ali said that the restrictions were extreme and that they would have severely hampered the potential of the talk if it had gone ahead. He said that President Musharraf had been insulted by the restrictions and had pulled out for that reason.

Deputy President (Clubs & Societies) Heather Jones said that she was disappointed that the talk could not go ahead, saying that it would have been “an interesting opportunity for students” but added that she felt the College were right to be cautious.
