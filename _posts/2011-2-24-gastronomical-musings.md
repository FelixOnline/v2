MasterChef. Nothing quite like another cooking programme to shove down our already gagging throats. Except MasterChef's been with us for almost twenty years so we can't exactly blast it for old time's sake. After creating various spin-offs to make celebrities think they can cook, in Celebrity MasterChef, and make young ones feel like there is meaning in life as they can always aspire to appearing on Junior MasterChef, the show has undergone a revamp. A revamp that is as tasteless as Cheryl Cole's fake tan. Because that is exactly what it felt like, an X Factor for the chefs. Taking a prime-time 9pm slot, I'm forced to watch as wannabe chefs sweat and glow a certain shade of ruby under the pressure of the new Masterchef kitchen. Bye bye white simplistic kitchen. Hello to tacky dramatic music when John and Gregg say yes or no. Now I'm just waiting for Wagner to turn up...
