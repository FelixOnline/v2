Following the success of previous editions, this year welcomes LUSO 2012, the Sixth Meeting of Portuguese Researchers and Students in the United Kingdom.

LUSO 2012 will take place on the 16th of June at the Senate House in London. Its main theme is “Powering-Up Portugal”, aimed at encouraging disclosure, communication and interaction in the fields of science, technology, entrepreneurship, and arts, among others. LUSO 2012 will host a diverse panel of prominent guest speakers from the academic, entrepreneurial, and political fields.

Some of the confirmed speakers include Nuno Crato (Portuguese Minister for Education and Science), Miguel Seabra (President, Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology), and Sir Tim Hunt (Nobel Prize Laureate in Physiology/Medicine 2001).

Notwithstanding being the annual meeting of Portuguese Researchers and Students in the United Kingdom, LUSO 2012 welcomes participants across all areas of study/work, ages and nationalities. Registration for LUSO 2012 will be open until 9 June.

More information can be found on LUSO 2012 website [__http://www.2012.luso.org.uk__](http://www.2012.luso.org.uk).
