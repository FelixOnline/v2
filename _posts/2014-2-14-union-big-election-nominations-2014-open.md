The nominations for the Union’s Big Elections 2014 opened this Monday. These elections determine who will fill key roles at the Union during the 2014-15 academic year.

The roles being contested include 7 full-time roles (Union President, the Union Deputy Presidents, the ICSMSU President and the Felix Editor), Student Trustees, Council Chair, Liberation officers, positions on Constituent Union Committees and postitions within departments.
