        <description>Anyone who thinks that this election is not about Brexit, is out of touch with the reality of the task ahead.

        <description>I haven’t had an abortion. In fact, I only know two people who have and they personally told me of it. One was a girl I went to school with, who had an abortion aged 15, and lost a lot of friends who had never realised they were pro-life until that moment. The other is my mother, who speaks about it …</description>

        <description>If there is a theme of the nominees for the BAFTAs for Best British Short Film and Best British Short Animation, it would probably be ‘journey’. Across the eight shorts, we are catapulted from one corner of the globe to the next, dealing with themes both big and small. One of the most engaging …</description>

        <description>It’s easy to look from the outside at a pride parade and see a unified grouping of similarly minded people. But under this facade of togetherness, within the LGBT community lies a volatile mixture of groups that sometimes have radically different goals.
