        <description>October has been full of fantastic releases: from synth pop to hip hop, from indie labels to industry juggernauts, from distinguished artists to new talent. Pay no mind to anyone who claims “there is no good music anymore”. At Felix we unfortunately don’t have the time to review everything good that …</description>

        <description>Hyperdub is odd. It’s always been odd. But it has knitted itself so tightly into the fabric of London’s musical culture that when two of its artists play experimental sets in an 18th century church, it somehow feels perfectly natural.
I arrived at the St. John Church in Hackney to find a substantial …</description>

        <description>Another night, another gig. This time at the temple of austere, brutalist beauty that is the Barbican. If you’re a fan of ambient music, this venue is a must – the sculpted wood of the concert hall reverberates with thick, earthy noise, immersing and inducing you into a trance-like state. The …</description>

        <description>Footwork is no longer confined to underground venues in the South Side of Chicago. The twisted style of house music has evolved to become a muse for electronic music producers across the globe, infecting deep into the rosters of prominent UK labels such as Hyperdub and Planet Mu. This expansion of …</description>

        <description>GoGo Penguin are a Mercury Prize nominated jazz trio who are lumped into the increasingly broad genre of modern jazz; a genre best separated from its predecessors by an unashamed acceptance of rhythm. Man Made Object is a testament to this. The album’s blend of classical jazz and modern house music …</description>
