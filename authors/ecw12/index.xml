        <description>Why bother writing an article about free speech today in Britain? We no longer ban books – surely freedom of speech is a concern of the past.
Unfortunately that is not the case. Just last month, the Barbican planned to launch an art exhibition based on a ‘human zoo’ of the type that were common for …</description>

        <description>20 candidates for a new type of hypervelocity star have been announced by an international team of astronomers.
These are stars travelling fast enough to completely escape our galaxy’s gravitational field, which means travelling at more than six hundred kilometres per second relative to the galaxy. …</description>

        <description>The invisibility cloak
Amrita Ghosh &amp;amp; Arya Mehta
So far, the most popular application of metamaterials being worked on is the ‘invisibility cloak’. This idea was first proposed by Professor Sir John Pendry. His team received a grant of £4.9 million to develop metamaterials for ‘invisibility …</description>

        <description>After hundreds of years of hypothesis, the primary function for sleep may now have been discovered. Maiken Nedergaard and colleagues this week released a paper detailing how in sleep the brain clears away waste proteins linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s that build up in the …</description>

        <description>Demetri Martin’s first book of drawings is an utterly beguiling read from start to finish. Perhaps it isn’t accurate to say ‘read’ as there are few words in it ­– each page is taken up by a new simple black-and-white line drawing of charming hilarity, ranging from a graph of melted cheese …</description>
