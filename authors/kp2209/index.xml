        <description>It is difficult to deny the existence of climate change when one points out the obvious effects it has already made on humanity.

        <description>This will be the eighteenth T in the Park taking place on the second weekend of July in the region of Kinross-shire, Scotland. Contrary to what the name may imply this is not your average tea party, or perhaps better said it’s nothing of the sort! Named after its main sponsor, the brewing company …</description>

        <description>“Two teas please.” Not the usual order one makes at a bar, however this is not a ‘usual’ gig. Mr. Scruff is not only famous for his random, yet surprisingly popular tea stands though. You can expect a full six hour DJ set from the man himself. A medley of hip-hop, jazz, swing and dubstep keep the …</description>

        <description>This dynamic duo, formally known as Cherry, fired up at Heaven. A set mainly compromised of tracks from Ratatat’s newest album LP4, was complemented by trippy video projections spanning the rear of the stage, creating a pleasantly multi-sensorial experience. Jungle beats were harmonised with warped …</description>
