        <description>It is, by now, almost common knowledge that changes in water temperatures will affect the biodiversity of marine life. Less research has been invested into the topic of how individuals and populations of surviving species will change in response to such developments. A model devised by a …</description>

        <description>Scientists at the University of Oxford have developed a pair of protein fragments dubbed ‘SpyTag’ and ‘SpyCatcher’ that form an incredibly strong bond.
