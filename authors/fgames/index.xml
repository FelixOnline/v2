        <description>Once in a blue moon, I actually buy my games from a brick and mortar store. The UK (and the rest of the world, to be honest) has been losing high street games retailers, to the digital distribution mammoths (Steam, Amazon, etc) and their slightly smaller and odd nephews (see: EA’s Origin). Offering …</description>

        <description>It’s been a question that has floated around Imperial College Union’s Gaming Club for years now – why don’t we play anyone else? This year, gears actually started moving.
On Thursday evening, in a quiet area of UCL, pizza was delivered and the party started. The LAN party. League of Legends (LoL), …</description>

        <description>Paladog
The evil of mankind was too much, and the Gods decided to replace us with a bunch of small sentient animals. A millenium later, bored demons attack, and the only warrior around is a West Highland Terrier on a horse. Makes sense.
You are Paladog, a noble warrior who can wield magic and summon …</description>

        <description>Hello Earth-dwellers, Cave Johnson here.
Firstly, I’ve got a note from the lab boys over in biochem, and they’ve told me to tell you not to eat any of the ‘Election Special’ range from the JCR. There’s something scribbled here about ‘politicitis’, and severe social repulsiveness. This news probably …</description>

        <description>Hello teary-eyed ladies, Cave Johnson here.
I know many of you were worried when I didn’t write in over the last fortnight — Caroline is still sorting through all the letters stained with your tears. No need to apologise — I know you missed me. I would miss me too. Who wouldn’t?

        <description>Hello test subjects, Cave Johnson here.
I find it hard to believe that it’s been a week since I last wrote for Felix – time sure does fly when you’re making the world a better place. Well actually, last week did go a bit faster than usual – I found my engineers playing with time again. You would …</description>

        <description>Hello Felix readers, Cave Johnson here.
Since last week’s article, we have had an amazing number of questions sent in — one. In all honesty, I was expecting no-one would read the piece, let alone send in a question. I think I’m beginning to like you, test subjects.
 If you had complete control over …</description>
