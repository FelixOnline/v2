        <description> A dark and windy November evening saw the men’s 2s head out to Harlington to take on a formidable Portsmouth 3s. With our captain Jimmy S, out injured due to a broken hand, coaching from the sidelines, ICHC got stuck in straight from the first whistle. To say the first half was a one sided affair …</description>

        <description>The Men’s 3’s overcame the odds to produce a sterling performance to embarrass St Bart’s 2s. Quick play mixed with characteristic flair saw the 3s put 4 past a solid Bart’s team.
After horrendous traffic, the men’s 3s arrived five minutes after the scheduled push off, meaning the first 11 on the …</description>

        <description>The mighty Men’s 3rds continued their fine form on and off the pitch by laying down a marker to their ULU rivals. Designer V scored an early brace before a potential comeback by Kings was snuffed out by a counter attack fortuitously finished off by B Tablet.
