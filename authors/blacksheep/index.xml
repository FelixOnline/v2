        <description>We are all somewhat superficial. Looks are an easy way to gauge the physiological and genetic stature of a potential mate (someone with one non-functional eye and no legs probably won’t be any good at fending off savage beasts), and so evolution has designed human beings to judge other members of …</description>

        <description>When I was 10 years old I started playing Rugby. I was an imposing 4ft 8” (though even that might be generous). With a career as the next England captain in front of me, I returned to pre season training with the under 11 squad for an introduction to full contact. So began 6 years of big kids …</description>

        <description>Our society pours so much scorn onto cheaters. After public outcry, John Terry was stripped of the England captaincy because of his infidelity. Can you imagine getting chucked out of university because of your personal life?
And speculation about whether Brangelina got together before or after his …</description>
