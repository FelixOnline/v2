        <description>One might think that, after having changed nine schools and two universities, I’d have gotten the hang of farewells.

        <description>A couple of weeks ago, Osama bin Laden was found and killed in Pakistan by the US. As is usually the case, a lot of banter and ridicule followed – one of which was a picture of Osama Bin Laden titled ‘Hide and Seek Champion: 2001– 2011’.

        <description>Before even thinking about the ‘special’ Valentine’s Day edition of Felix I can, with a certainty of about 99.99% say that we will be reading loads of complaints about it being just another one of those capitalist holidays.
