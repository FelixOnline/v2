        <description>Over the past nine or so months (and, if I’m honest, much earlier than that), I’ve often found myself being thrust into conversations around topics of race, ethnicity, and identity. More than once, I’ve been asked all manner of questions or for my take on a number of issues, many of which I haven’t …</description>

        <description>Arguably the most anticipated film of 2018 arrived last week. Black Panther, the latest addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe canon, and directed by Ryan Coogler, was released in cinemas worldwide this February.
Black Panther is set in the fictional country of Wakanda, a technologically advanced …</description>

        <description>It’s rather tricky to run for a position that isn’t well defined – earlier this year, while campaigning for the role of BME Officer, more often than not I’d have to explain what the whole acronym meant (for those of you who still don’t know, that’s Black and Minority Ethnic); even then I’d have to …</description>

        <description>Just last week, the government released its sixty-odd page Race Disparity Report, commissioned by the Prime Minister Theresa May early on in her tenure.

        <description>I get these questions all the time: “Who’s your favourite rapper?”, “I bet you can freestyle!”, “How can you not love Tupac? You’re black!”
