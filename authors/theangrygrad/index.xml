        <description>While my usual pieces have a satirical take on pop culture, this week, I thought it was about time my graduate anger is channelled towards an issue that actually has some weight.

        <description>Graduation day. Supposed to be a milestone, right? One of the happiest days of your lives, some people (morons) say. Well, not if I, the Angry Grad, have anything to do with it.
