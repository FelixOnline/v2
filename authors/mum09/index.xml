        <description>The gig was hosted at Barfly which provided an intimate setting, for what was a show for competition winners. Kurt Vile had not brought a backing band along on this occasion and he made everyone wait. The crowds were a bunch of happy campers though –true to the stoner spirit. They did not mind one …</description>

        <description>After their successful release of Fragrant World, Yeasayer decided to grace the Shepherd’s Bush Empire with a set list heavy on songs from their latest album. In the air was a whiff of dope.
The crowd roared as the band took to their space station, which was designed to look like a stage. Kicking …</description>

        <description>The night was kicked off by LULS who did a great job at gathering everyone around the stage. Firing on all cylinders, they sang “Swing Low” – a dark, demented pop melody that echoed across the walls of the venue. A short but sweet set which left me aching to hearing more from this tight young band. …</description>

        <description>On the 14th of November, Adam Green and Binki Shapiro graced the charming Bush Hall in Shepherd’s Bush with what one could probably describe as unique blend of lo-fi indie folk pop. Their set opened with ‘If You Want Me To’ and after a choppy start, mostly due to the sound technician’s epic struggle …</description>

        <description>We are going to start this review with a bold statement: Kurt Vile’s _Smoke Rings for my Halo _was the hottest album of 2011. No matter how poignant PJ Harvey’s Let England Shake was or how acclaimed the Horror’s Skying was, no-one can convince us otherwise. It was with this in mind that we headed …</description>
