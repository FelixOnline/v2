        <description>Common knowledge to anyone who actually wants to embark upon a career in the near future, the world economy is dragging its feet along the ground and practically all global growth has been brought to a grinding halt.

        <description> Undoubtedly one of the most recognised modern buildings in the UK, The Gherkin (officially known as 30 St Mary Axe) is magnificently impressive from the outside, yet even more so from the 19th floor up.

        <description>There has long existed a debate in regards to the reasons behind fashion photography.
