        <description>The composition of the Earth’s core has been a mystery to scientists for nearly 60 years. While we know much about how this section of our planet affects us in terms of magnetism, energy generation and planetary dynamics, its precise makeup has remained hazy. Until recently all we knew was that the …</description>
