        <description>Light Asylum; the dark wave, ‘enough-balls-to-bust-up-Schwarzenegger’, electroclash duo from Brooklyn are Shannon Funchess and Bruno Coviello. They came for Club Motherfucker’s eighth birthday at Elephant and Castle’s Corsica Studios. The pair address the stage like a boxing ring with the crowd as …</description>

        <description>Mike Skinner&amp;rsquo;s music is like Marmite, you either love The Streets or you hate them. You can, however, hate them and over time learn to love them, which is exactly what happened to my opinion of The Streets, after listening to this new album Computers and Blues [spotify]. I must say that this …</description>

        <description>“Imagine there’s no heaven
It’s easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today&amp;hellip;
It must be accepted that we are each unique in completely different ways, physically as well as mentally. Each person has their own personal way of thinking, their own …</description>

        <description>We as human beings cannot help but think. We exist because we think and have an unexplained stream of consciousness that puts us into existence. It is not true to say that without our ability to think intelligently we would not exist; we would simply be unable to explain, or attempt to explain it. …</description>

        <description>As electronic music surges through the cables that are the circulatory systems of London’s nightclubs, some musical styles have taken steps towards infiltrating this electronic dominance in today’s music scene, notably contempory R&amp;amp;B/Hip-Hop and Pop.

        <description>I have to admit that reggae and psychedelia is not an orthodox blend, come to think of it, it’s hardly like anything out there, and that’s what makes me admire the Easy Star All-Stars for doing something different. Different is not always good, and for those of you who hold the likes of Pink Floyd …</description>

        <description>Two joyous rabbits called Flipsy and Flopsy were bounding through a southern isle, frolicking in the late sunshine and falling leaves, hopping over mushrooms and nibbling at colourful carrots. Suddenly, they found themselves before an enormous stage, stunned, and they looked up to see a dancing …</description>

        <description>It is a wet and windy evening in Shepherd’s Bush, a resounding confirmation that autumn is indeed upon us and we can now forget our fancy dress frolics at Bestival et al and concentrate on huddling like arctic penguins in the cosy confines of our metropolis’ musical communes, such as the intimate …</description>

        <description>A small band with big sounds, they are a London-based electronic duo who have enough energy to outrun the energizer bunny. They’re on the road to be quite the big deal. Here’s what Kye and Anthony had to say before they performed at Bestival this summer.
Diagram of the Heart is quite an exquisite …</description>
