        <description>Iam ten minutes late by the time I get on the line to Anjeli Patel – not something I reckon would be taken lightly at Ernst &amp;amp; Young LLP, where she works as an associate in assurance within Wealth and Asset management.

        <description>FELIX has discovered that the Chinese university that will partner with Imperial at a new tech hub on the White City campus has been cited by a US security firm as being a recruitment hotspot for the unit of the Chinese army alleged to be involved in the country’s cyberwarfare program.

        <description>I read Nina Segal’s script for in “In the Night Time” in a mad, streaming rush, coffee on fingertips on pages in the dregs of whisky and sleep. It deserved every one of my 5am minutes, and more.
“At this very moment, the universe itself is leaving us behind. Receding.

        <description>Ben Kidd bounds into a Notting Hill basement in between a kebab shop and a pizzeria. For the first time, Gate publicity maestro Tash Brown looks a tad worried. She needn’t be. Gate’s work is exactly the kind of thing I wish we had more of here at Imperial. Passionately done and served up with a …</description>

        <description>Here’s a picture of Malaysian PM Najib Razak. Malaysian police responded to this image by warning the author that the image was ‘offensive’. They then threatened that if he didn’t ‘act within the law’, he would be arrested.
This, of course, had nothing to do with the fact that someone rich and …</description>

        <description>Fresh outta West Basement, this comedy virgin headed out to meet Knock2Bag. Hailed by Time Out as some of the best comedy in the East End at brilliant value, it had a lot to live up to.
On the menu this month – a four course slap up of sexuality, served up light with a little Irish on the side. Each …</description>

        <description>Waste is true to the name, a play about dashed hopes and broken dreams. It’s a damnably English affair.
