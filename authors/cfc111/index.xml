        <description>From the title to the timing, McQueen at the St James’ Theatre has all the hallmarks of a cheesy opportunistic bio-drama. But despite the tormented genius stereotype it conforms to, James Philip’s play is a brave, moving, and enchanting portrayal of a person’s struggle with mental health.

        <description>A politically engaged play in a small theatre in South London. There have been many of these and, in the glorious tradition of fringe theatre, there will be more; but The Siege at the Battersea Art Centre is something entirely different, unique even in London’s multifaceted subversive theatre scene. …</description>

        <description>A film about a successful, rich, lonely businesswoman who falls in love with a handsome, dangerous jihadist she meets on a plane. She’s a 9&amp;frasl;11 widow; he’s an Al-Qaeda terrorist. Scenes of torrid sex followed by moments of rising hysteria, as the full extent of the jihadist’s plans are …</description>

        <description>Just when we thought there couldn’t possibly be another _Romeo and Juliet _reinterpretation, the Tamasha Theatre Company chipped in with their own modern tale of star-crossed lovers (can’t talk about that play without saying the word star-crossed folks, it’s a legal requirement for reviewing).

        <description>It would be understandable if a comic opera about a love triangle – featuring a randy Turkish prince, a doddering old man, and his unfaithful young wife – struggled to be relevant. Throw in a few jokes about Gypsies, the inconstancy of women, and old men falling into plates of spaghetti and it turns …</description>

        <description>A tenuous numerical link is enough to lead us from the significance of the grand history of Felix, now its 1600th issue, to 1600 AD, a year in the life of Early Modern Europe. In dear old Blighty, Elizabeth I is on the throne, busily destroying the Armada and maintaining her virginity. Martin Luther …</description>

        <description>Onegin is a 1960s German ballet based on a 19th century Russian novel in verse.
Let the staleness of that sentence fully sink in before continuing, and then think again. The Royal Opera’s revival of Onegin is far, far from stale, but rather a dramatic masterpiece set to rousing music and performed …</description>

        <description>A hipster little theatre in Kilburn. A cast of young actors. An improvised piece on the meaning of life. As far as hints go, the Secret Theatre production of A Series of Increasingly Impossible Acts hadn’t got me too fired up.

        <description>Fiscal responsibility and council politics – possibly the most unglamorous combination.

        <description>A rich, famous and respectable man has his private life dragged through the tabloids. “The Sir and the school girl!” the media cries.
