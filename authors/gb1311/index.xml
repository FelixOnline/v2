        <description>This week I finished my degree. “Congratulations, you have completed Mech Eng!” said the figurative game graphic as I answered the last question of my presentation. Somehow I managed to do four years of my degree without failing an exam (hopefully anyway, there’s still chance), and probably getting …</description>

        <description>Mental health is the great un-tackled health problem in the UK.
In a year 1 in 4 adults will experience a mental health problem and suicide is the biggest killer of men under the age of 35.
This week’s results from the ‘Mentality’ campaign show that Imperial is no exception. Of those who completed …</description>

        <description>The Liberal Democrats have had the number of their MPs slashed from 57 to just eight. Members of Parliament who have been in government for 30 years are no longer. Part of their downfall can be attributed to their support of raising tuition fees, part to supporting the Conservatives, and part of it …</description>

        <description>If you have 400 Facebook friends aged 16 to 24, the chances are that 14 of them have generalised anxiety disorder, 35 of them have self-harmed and 24 of them have attempted suicide. Over our life time, a quarter of us will suffer from a mental health problem.

        <description>I’ve now spent four years studying as an undergraduate at Imperial. That feels like a long time – I don’t really remember the anxious teenager who arrived here in 2011, who was unsure of how to organise a weekly shop and do the laundry. I seem to have regressed in my organisation of chores, as my …</description>

        <description>This week’s Charlie Hebdo poster features a cartoon man portrayed as the prophet Mohammed, crying and holding a sign reading “_Je suis Charlie._” Above is the slogan “Tout est pardonné” (You’re forgiven).
Many Muslim people find this offensive. Not just because Islam forbids portraying the prophet …</description>

        <description>Imperial College Union is vast. It has 344 different societies, and every year they collectively turn over £2 million. The entire Union turns over £7 million. There are 3000 different society committee positions and 40% of undergraduate students are a member of at least one club or society.

        <description>I was sat in a job interview, nervously trying to justify my existence to a stranger and I was asked “Why did you chose to study at Imperial?”. I think I managed to persuade him it wasn’t because Cambridge had rejected me and that it was in fact, “Imperial’s academic rigour and forward thinking …</description>

        <description>I love a good space mission. Pushing the final frontier, venturing into the unknown, lots of robots, rockets and risk – as a budding engineer, what more could I want?
Space missions have been used to inspire future scientists and engineers for generations: from the Apollo landings and the ill-fated …</description>

        <description>What does £220,000 a year get you? It’s more than the combined rent of the 22 new beds in Beit Hall over a calendar year, two-thirds of the former rector’s salary of £364,000 (Times High Education Supplement) and 0.22%of Imperial College London’s £97 million endowment. £220,000 is also how much has …</description>

        <description>You have a student radio station. It’s in Beit’s West basement, just next to the Felix office and to be frank, it’s pretty awesome. We have about 10,000 CDs and vinyls down there, we host live bands from our recording studio (yep, got one of them too) and you can have listen at www.ICRadio.com. The …</description>

        <description>Last week Felix published an article discussing the differences in workload between Oxbridge and Imperial. ‘Who works harder?’ seemed to be the question it was asking. It threw lots of figures at the reader and seemed to suggest that Oxbridge gives students more contact hours and was much better …</description>

        <description>This week the biggest libel case in legal history was launched – thousands of people are potentially facing legal action and most of them are ‘normal people’. Why? Because anyone who tweeted or re-tweeted Lord McAlpine’s name in relation to child abuse allegations is going to get a letter from his …</description>

        <description>Right now the NUS is congratulating itself on a job well done. Despite the rain it got ten thousand students out on the street, fights didn’t break out, there were enough placards to go around and the biggest cock up was when the President, Liam Burns, was egged and suffered a stage invasion by …</description>

        <description>The BBC has been having an interesting few days. Or at least a small part of the investigative journalism section has. Not only do they fail to broadcast an allegation about Jimmy Savile, leaving it to ITV to do so several months later, but they accidentally aired a report from someone suggesting …</description>
