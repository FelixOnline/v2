        <description>While no Imperial Student will be a stranger to technology, I imagine not all share Black Mirror’s pessimistic view of tech as an existential threat. Despite creator Charlie Brooker claiming that his show is more warning than fear-mongering, the show focuses on how technology exacerbates the flaws …</description>

        <description>A grown man, wearing a snapback and a Rick and Morty t-shirt, leaps up on the counter of an American McDonald’s, and demands his dipping sauce.

        <description>After two years and five seasons worth of episodes between the characters, Marvel’s darker and grittier street level heroes finally come together Avengers-style.

        <description>While offering some great adventures, this season lands between the previous two, as more time is devoted to the resolution of existing plot lines than the creation of new ones. Some might argue that this is a natural development of overarching plot lines introduced in earlier episodes – which this …</description>

        <description>Two years ago, comedian Aziz Ansari debuted his Netflix original series, Master of None.

        <description>Having four shows set in a shared universe and on the same channel meant a crossover was inevitable. It was certainly ambitious, especially on a TV network budget, but I’m glad to say they were able to pull it off.
With a diverse range of characters from DC comics, the crossover is essentially a …</description>

        <description>Following last week’s relatively uneventful, measured episode, Game of Thrones cranks the dial up to eleven with this one. Last time was the safety briefing; now we’ve hit the first drop on the rollercoaster.
We open in Winterfell of old, as Bran and the Three-eyed Raven watch the previous …</description>

        <description>After slapping viewers in the face last season with another huge character death, Game of Thrones returned this week with a relatively uneventful episode, filled with set up for the rest of the season. Spoilers ahead (obviously).

        <description>Netflix recently has rolled out measures to ban people from using proxies to access their service.

        <description>These days it seems like the most popular medium for TV shows to take inspiration from is the literary one. With several books, graphic novels and comics, sometimes with decades of mythology, it’s hard to see why not. When something works in a medium where scenes are static or left to the …</description>

        <description>This show really snuck up on me. HBO seems to have pushed it out without the sort of fanfare one would expect; especially given the names attached to this project. When Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger say they’re doing something together, you pay attention. So, I decided to give the two hour …</description>
