His hands were crabs, his feet were fish, his soul the sea. He wept for days that could not be, he wept for years to be. He had but only two sons, both were to be of sea but one gave land his hand.
But I am your King! Are you not my brother? …</description>

Too much time to play the cynic, Glad to be your biggest critic, Lacking purpose and direction, But keen to give all my affection.

        <description>When they said that you see a bright light when you die, you did not realise that it was actually a 60 watt desk-lamp.

        <description>Who’s hiding in the trees? Who’s watching me through dark leaves, as I run through Battersea Park at 5 minutes to midnight?
