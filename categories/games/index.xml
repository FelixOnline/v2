        <description>Let me make one thing clear: I am absolutely biased. Halo Reach was a significant part of my teenagedom; I spent a frankly unhealthy amount of hours sprinting around the wide landscapes and vast alien structures of the original game. It defined my social life – I’d host huge all-night LAN parties …</description>

        <description>Shitty weather, extreme fatigue and incessantly annoying Christmas music. There are many signs that the end of the year is upon us, but one that is much cheerier – and a great topic of discussion – is The Game Awards. Effectively the Oscars of video games, The Game Awards celebrates the best games …</description>

        <description>As an avid fan of all things gaming, I love to look over at my wall and see stacks of games lining the shelves. From the Atari 2600 to the Nintendo Switch, I love them all; unfortunately, I have a student budget which does not come close to fuelling my need for games. Over the years, though, I have …</description>

        <description>Now I don’t know about you, but Digimon was the bread and butter of my childhood, with its classic animation style and collection of surprisingly dark moments. I’m still traumatised by their equivalent of Sean Bean, Leomon, who seemingly could not go an episode without falling.
So you can imagine …</description>

        <description>Right, listen up everyone. You’re all wrong. Pokémon Sword and Shield are amazing, the hate for it is, for the most part, unfounded, and here’s why.
First of all, a quick disclaimer: this is a review of Pokémon Sword and Shield. I have fully completed Shield and am working my way through Sword …</description>

        <description>So, this is where it all began. In 1997 Interplay Entertainment released Fallout: A Post Nuclear Roleplaying Game. Even though this is the first official Fallout game, it was originally developed as a sequel to 1988’s Wasteland. After Interplay lost the rights to Wasteland, Fallout took on its own …</description>

        <description>Earlier this year, Paramount released a trailer for the new Sonic the Hedgehog movie. One word describes this: terrifying. The render of Sonic was closer to a deformed cat than to what Sonic should look like in the games. Boasting human-like teeth that a dentist would be proud of (clearly flossing) …</description>

        <description>The SSX franchise is the Tony Hawk’s Skateboarding of the snow (sorry Shawn White). Fast-paced, meticulous focus on gameplay, absolutely amazing soundtracks and a few failures recently with the franchise… But I am not here to tell you about all the bad with SSX, I’m here to spout about the pure …</description>

        <description>Browsing one of my favourite gaming news websites, Destructoid, I came across a recommendation for this game (currently sold for $1 on Humble Bundle and £3.99 on Steam).

        <description>Bethesda. A name which, until recently, brought joy to many people’s ears. On the 14th November 2018, this all changed; the release of Fallout 76 was the beginning of a year of seemingly endless controversy. Why are we bringing this up again you ask? Well, after all the issues which have cropped up …</description>

The latest in a long-running list of Nintendo’s whacky peripheral ideas: Ring Fit Adventure, fight demons whilst doing pilates. Last month Nintendo announced the game seemingly out of nowhere.

        <description>Tetris. A game we all know and love. Some dub it the ‘Perfect Game’ and for good reason. Created in 1984 in the USSR by Alexey Pajitnov, it quickly took the world by storm with its addictive yet deceptively simple gameplay. Selling over 170 million copies to date, the general concept has remained …</description>
